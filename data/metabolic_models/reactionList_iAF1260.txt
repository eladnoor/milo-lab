Little is known about the transport and metabolism of SeO32- in vivo. It has been proposed that SeO32- reacts with free thiols such as glutathione to form selenodiglutathione (5) (Fig. 6). Subsequent reactions with glutathione reductase, with reduced thioredoxin, or with excess free glutathione will lead to further reduction to selenide (1, 4).

No mention of fucose 6-phosphate in the artile, so I think that it is a typo in NH.  Also, it show that glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 3-phosphate are probably not substrates due to binding affinity and it does not prove/disprove that fructose 1-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate are substrates, even though they were reported to possibly be substrates previously by others.////In NH, it states that the antiport ratio, determined in L. lactis, moves from the upper limit of 2:1 at pH 7 to a lower limit of 1:1 at pH 5.2.

However, some scientists think this may not be the case and the accumulation of PE inside the cell in msbA mutants arises from it sticking to the lipid A that is not moved out of the cell, so the phenotype is not due to a PE transport defect.

The peripheral membrane proteins are thought to function in regulation rather than energy coupling. TrkE maps to the sapABCDF operon which encodes an ABC transporter (TC #3.A.1.5.5), and the SapD ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein of E. coli can stimulate K+ uptake via either TrkH or TrkG (Harms et al., 2001). Therefore, SapD is probably TrkE. ATP binding to SapD, rather than ATP hydrolysis, appears to activate. Thus, the pmf drives transport while ATP binding activates transport. At least one other ATP-activating protein is probably present in the E. coli cell (Harms et al., 2001).////Termodynamic analysis suggests that the reaction is irreversible in the import direction.//AMF

However, some scientists think this may not be the case and the accumulation of PE inside the cell in msbA mutants arises from it sticking to the lipid A that is not moved out of the cell, so the phenotype is not due to a PE transport defect.  This implies the existence of another transporter that moves phospholipids, but it has not been identified. So we wait for more definitive experiments.'//AMF

E. coli cells formed mannitol lipids irrespective of the presence of the mtl-2 allele, which should have caused a defect in specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system (2, 16), the sole transport system for mannitol (9). Therefore, the most probable site of the cardiolipin synthase reaction for analog lipid formation is the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. This also supports the notion that mannitol was incorporated into the lipids without prior phosphorylation or other structural modifications.¿////Suggests reversibility://¿If this reaction is reversible and if the substrate specificity is not strict, then the alcoholysis of cardiolipin in the presence of high concentration of, for instance, D-mannitol may yield phosphatidylmannitol and phosphatidylglycerol, and further condensation may give rise to diphosphatidylmannitol (Fig. 3)¿////yhbO- reported to not be functional inside of the cell.

E. coli cells formed mannitol lipids irrespective of the presence of the mtl-2 allele, which should have caused a defect in specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system (2, 16), the sole transport system for mannitol (9). Therefore, the most probable site of the cardiolipin synthase reaction for analog lipid formation is the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. This also supports the notion that mannitol was incorporated into the lipids without prior phosphorylation or other structural modifications.¿////Suggests reversibility://¿If this reaction is reversible and if the substrate specificity is not strict, then the alcoholysis of cardiolipin in the presence of high concentration of, for instance, D-mannitol may yield phosphatidylmannitol and phosphatidylglycerol, and further condensation may give rise to diphosphatidylmannitol (Fig. 3)¿////yhbO- reported to not be functional inside of the cell.
