				<div class="faqQuestion">How do I search for a compound or enzyme?</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>You can search for a compound or enzyme by entering their common name into the search box.
				As you type, you should see a list of potential matches, which should give you a sense of what eQuilibrator
				thinks you are looking for. To the right of each suggestion you will see they type of the match: "Compound" or "Enzyme".
				
			  Complete your search by selecting a compound or enzyme from the list or typing the name in full.
				When you've finished typing your query, click 'Search' or press 'Enter' to see search results.</p>
				
				<p>The search results page shows the top matches for your query. Results are shown in two sections: one for compounds 
				and another for enzymes. If you're interested in a compound, click on it to see more details and to change the 
				conditions of &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G estimation. If you're interested in an enzyme, click on the enzyme name to 
				see detailed information about it. If you want to explore the thermodynamics of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction,
				choose a reaction listed under the enzyme name to get a &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G estimation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faqEntry" id="rxnSearch">
				<div class="faqQuestion">How do I search for a reaction?</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>You can search for a reaction by entering an (almost) free-text string of the reaction.
				For example, you can type "glucose = 2 ethanol + 2 co2".</p>
				
				<p>In general, write your reaction using " = " to separate the reactants from the products.
				The spaces around " = " are required. Always use spaces before and after compound names, "+"
				and stoichiometric coefficients.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="faqEntry" id="notAvailable">
				<div class="faqQuestion">Why is &Delta;G "not available?"</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>There are several reasons that a &Delta;G value might not be available.</p>
				
				<p>&Delta;<sub>f</sub>G is very difficult to measure experimentally. We use the group contribution
				method to estimate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G for compounds that have not been characterized experimentally [3-4].
				However, we need certain data about a compound in order to approximate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.</p>

				<p>Our list of compounds is taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes and Genes (<a href="http://www.kegg.jp">KEGG</a>) [5].
				Occasionally, KEGG compound entries don't contain an InChI identifier. Without an InChI identifier we cannot 
				compute the structure of the compound and without structural information we can't estimate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.</p>
				
				<p>In some cases, a compound may contain a chemical group that was not observed in any of the compounds that have experimental
				&Delta;<sub>f</sub>G measurements. We cannot produce estimates for these compounds as we cannot estimate the contribution
				of unknown groups. In other cases, our algorithm for analyzing compound structure fails to decompose the compound
				into groups. If we are unable to decompose the compound then we cannot use the group contribution method.</p>
				
				<p>Moreover, we can't estimate &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G for any reaction that contains a compound that we cannot estimate
				&Delta;<sub>f</sub>G for.</p>

			<div class="faqEntry" id="stdConditions">
				<div class="faqQuestion">What are "standard conditions?"</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>"Standard conditions" implies that all substrates and products of a reaction are at 1 M concentration.
				If their concentrations are different, it will affect the &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="faqEntry" id="hConcentration">
				<div class="faqQuestion">Why can't I change the concentration of Hydrogen ions?</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>eQuilibrator uses the "Alberty method" for biochemical thermodynamics.
				In the Alberty method, H+ is defined to have 0 free energy [1-2].
				Instead of correcting for H+ concentration, a pH correction accounts for the abundance of H+.
				You can use the pH "slider" to see the effect of H+ concentration on your reaction. 
				</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faqEntry" id="waterConcentration">
				<div class="faqQuestion">Why can't I change the concentration of water?</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>Biochemical systems are generally assumed to be aqueous environments [1-2].
				Therefore, the concentration of water is fixed.
				</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="faqEntry" id="changeTemp">
				<div class="faqQuestion">Why can't I change the temperature?</div>
				
				<div class="faqAnswer">
				<p>The temperature is fixed at 25 &deg;C (298.15 K) for all &Delta;G values given.
				
				The group contribution method allows us to approximate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G of compounds at
				a particular temperature (the temperature at which they were measured) [4]. As the change in free energy
				is defined as &Delta;G = &Delta;H - T&Delta;S and we don't know the value of &Delta;S in most cases, we
				cannot predict how changes in temperature will affect &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G.

	      <div class="faqEntry" id="aqueousCO2">
	        <div class="faqQuestion">What are CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) and CO<sub>2</sub>(total)?</div>
	        
	        <div class="faqAnswer">
	        <p>CO2(aq) is dissolved CO2. Dissolved CO2 undergoes a spontaneous hydration reaction:</p>
	        
	        <p>
	        CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O <=> H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>The rate of the uncatalyzed hydration reaction is t<sub>1/2</sub> = 15 seconds. In some
	        species this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which speeds it up
	        by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> [6]. In aqueous environments, CO2 is generally considered to be
	        in equilibrium with its hydrated forms - carbonic acid, bicarbonate and carbonate. CO2(total)
	        represents the collection of species including dissolved CO2 and its 3 hydrated forms.</>
	        
	        <p>It is generally simpler to measure the concentration of CO2(total) than it is to measure
	        the individual species. As such, it is common to apply the equilibrium assumption and use
	        CO2(total) in place of CO2(aq) in biochemical reactions. If you can measure the concentration
	        of CO2(aq), then it is reasonable to use it as a reactant.</p>

	      <div class="faqEntry" id="halfReactions">
	        <div class="faqQuestion">What do you mean "electrons are not balanced?" What about half-reactions?</div>
	        
	        <div class="faqAnswer">
	        <p>Unlike in metals, there are no free electrons in solution. As such, reactions entered in eQuilibrator must 
	        be redox balanced. That is, the products must contain the same number of electrons as the reactants. You 
	        cannot currently enter half-reactions in eQuilibrator; eQuilibrator checks the redox balance of reactions
	        when you search for them and provides automatic balancing using the electron donor/acceptor NAD+/NADH.
	        If you wish to use another donor/acceptor pair, you can do so manually. You can adjust the concentrations
	        of the donor and acceptor in order to adjust the reduction potential of your chosen redox carrier.</p>
	        
	        <p>If the above paragraph was not clear to you, here is a review of the basics of the energetics of redox reactions.</p>
	        
	        <p>
	        Redox reactions are a special case of biochemical reactions, where electrons are transferred from one compound to another.
	        It is common to consider the compound which looses the electrons and consequently changes to its oxidized form as the
	        electron donor, and the compound which gains electrons and changes to its reduced form as the electron acceptor.
	        For example, in the reaction <a href="http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/reaction?reactionId=R00342">L-malate + NAD+ → oxaloacetate + NADH</a>,
	        L-malate is the electron donor and is oxidized to oxaloacetate. NAD+ is the electron acceptor and is reduced to NADH.
	        Since all of the reactants are soluble metabolites with explicit chemical formulas, one can calculate their formation
	        energies and use them to deduce the &Delta;G of the reaction like in any other biochemical reaction.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        There are several compounds that are used mainly for electron transfer. They are called electron carriers or redox carriers.
	        For example, the pair NAD+:NADH, NADP+:NADPH, and ubiquinone:ubiquinol are all common electron donors or acceptors in many redox reactions.
	        Since they are not chemically involved in these reactions (except by electron transfer) it is useful to define their standard reduction potential
	        (E<sub>0</sub>) which reflects the affinity of the oxidized form for electrons (calculated assuming that H2 is the electron donor).
	        Electrons tend to flow from a lower potential to a higher one. In biological systems, it is common to define the reduction potential at a specific pH, denoted E’<sub>0</sub>. 
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        The reduction potential of NAD+:NADH is E’<sub>0</sub> = -0.32 V and the reduction potential of O2:H2O is E’<sub>0</sub> = 0.82 V (both at the pH 7).
	        Therefore, electrons will tend to flow from NADH to O2 producing NAD+ and H2O.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	  		Reduction potentials can be defined and measured for any electron source or sink, not only for soluble electron carriers.
	  		However, when a reaction involves only soluble electron carriers, performing calculations using reduction potentials is equivalent to using the
	  		change in &Delta;G’<sub>0</sub> of formation of the oxidized and reduced forms. The equation for converting E’<sub>0</sub> to &Delta;G’<sub>0</sub>
	  		is: &Delta;G’<sub>0</sub> = -nF &Delta;E’<sub>0</sub> (where n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday’s constant that represents the charge
	  		of 1 mol of electrons or 9.65∙104 C∙mol-1). For example, the ∆G’0 attributed to the oxidation of NADH by O2 is -2∙F∙(0.82 - (-0.32)) = -220 kJ/mol.
	  		eQuilibrator provides the same result for this reaction: <a href="/search?query=NADH+%2B+0.5+O2+%3C%3D%3E+NAD%2B+%2B+H2O">NADH + 0.5 O2 <=> NAD+ + H2O</a>.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>
	        Currently, eQuilibrator only deals with soluble compounds, and therefore all electron carriers can be handled via their formation energies,
	        without the need to explicitly specify their redox potentials. The reduced and oxidized forms of these electron carriers are two distinct
	        chemicals and each is treated as a separate entity in eQuilibrator. For example, oxidized FMN and reduced FMN. In some cases, the formation
	        energy of the redox pair is unknown and we know only the difference between the formation energies of the two forms. In these situations,
	        the oxidized form is typically defined to have a formation energy of 0 and the reduced form has a value which is relative to that
	        (as is the case with FMN). These relative formation energies are equivalent reduction potentials.
	        </p>
	        
	        <p>Currently, free electrons are not recognized by eQuilibrator, and therefore half-reactions (such as NAD+ + 2 e- <=> NADH) are not allowed.
	        In the future, we plan to allow half-reactions and to enable using other types of redox carriers such as cytochromes or metal ions.
