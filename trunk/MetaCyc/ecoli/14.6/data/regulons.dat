COMMENT - QseB, "<b>q</b>uorum-<b>s</b>ensing <i><b>E</b>. coli</i> regulator <b>B</b>", is the response regulator component of the QseB-QseC two-component system, which is one component of the quorum-sensing regulatory cascade involved in the positive regulation of flagella and motility genes by activating transcription of <i>flhDC</i>, an operon that encodes the master regulator of these genes |CITS: [11929534]|.
/
/This protein also may have an undetermined role in metal metabolism, because <i>qseBC</i> deletion mutants show hypersensitivity to several toxic cations |CITS: [12897016]|.
/
/QseB and QseC of enterohemorrhagic <i> E. coli</i> (EHEC) and of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are almost identical; there are only three amino acid differences in QseB and only eight amino acid differences in QseC between these strains |CITS: [11929534]|. It was demonstrated in EHEC that QseC directly senses and binds the bacterial hormone-like AI-3 signal and the host epineprhine/norepineprhine hormones, and it causes the autophosphorylation of QseC, which then transfers the phosphate group to QseB to activate it |CITS: [16803956]|.
/
/The expression of the operon containing both genes <i>qseB</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>qseC</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, is regulated by a quorum-sensing system |CITS: [11929534]|, and the regulatory region of the operon is 99.6% identical to the regulatory region of the same operon in EHEC |CITS: [16194231]|.

COMMENT - CusR, "<b>Cu</b>-<b>s</b>ensing <b>r</b>egulator",  regulates genes related to the copper and silver efflux systems |CITS:[11004187][11283292]| under anaerobic growth and under extreme copper stress in aerobic growth |CITS:[11399769]|. CusR belongs to the two-component system CusS/CusR, which responds to increases in the copper concentration. Both <i>cusR</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>cusS</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, are organized in an operon that is located next to and in the opposite direction to an operon whose expression is activated by CusR |CITS:[11004187]|. The sensor proteins YedW, UhpB, and YedV, which also belong to two-component systems, can activate CusR via signal cross talk |CITS:[15773991][15522865]|.
/
/This protein binds to the CusR box, which is a palindromic sequence also conserved in other organisms; the sequence is located in the regulatory regions of genes involved in copper-responsive systems and is regulated by proteins homologous to CusR |CITS:[11004187]|. In the whole genome of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, only one copper box has been identified |CITS:[15773991]|.

COMMENT - ArcA is a dual transcriptional regulator for <b>a</b>noxic <b>r</b>edox <b>c</b>ontrol |CITS:[2964639][8412675][7855430]|. It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions. ArcA represses operons involved in respiratory metabolism, encoding products such as tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, and enzymes of the pathway for fatty acid degradation |CITS:[2070418][7855430][1812811]|. In addition, it acts as a repressor for <i>rpoS</i> transcription |CITS:[16291649]|. ArcA activates a few operons encoding proteins involved in fermentative metabolism |CITS:[8071220][8892825]|. Microarray analyses have identified a large number of genes affected by ArcA and have revealed that the Arc system and the FNR regulatory network overlap to a much greater extent than previously estimated |CITS:[15699038][14711822][15838044]|. It has been suggested that the most significant role of ArcA is under microaerobic conditions, while that of FNR is under more strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS:[12486057][15669087]|. For full expression of <i>arcA</i> both FNR and ArcA are required |CITS:[8022271]|.
/
/ArcA is a response regulator and is activated as a DNA-binding protein by phosphorylation |CITS:[11527965]|. The cognate sensor kinase ArcB is membrane associated and has three cytoplasmic domains, a transmitter, a receiver, and a phosphotransfer (HPt) domain |CITS:[7957084][1597416]|. Under anaerobic conditions ArcA is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain of ArcB to the receiver and Hpt domain of ArcB and finally to the receiver domain of ArcA |CITS:[10851007][8825099][9286997]|. Autophosphorylation of ArcB is stimulated by effectors, such as d-lactate, pyruvate, and acetate |CITS:[10585483][10585483]|. Under aerobic conditions, the autokinase activity of ArcB is inhibited by quinone electron carriers |CITS:[11423658][15326287]|, and unphosphorylated ArcB promotes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by a reverse phosphorelay reaction |CITS:[9830034][15838055]|. It has been suggested that ArcA may also be subject to cross-regulation by other, unknown sensor kinases |CITS:[16291649][12366850][17213678]|.
/
/ArcA is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators consisting of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain  |CITS:[9205844]|. The crystal structures of the receiver domain of ArcA in the presence and absence of the phosphoryl analog BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>?</sup> have been solved |CITS:[15876365]|. In the crystal structures, the receiver domain forms a symmetric dimer.
/
/Weight matrices for the DNA-binding site for ArcA-P have been obtained. The proposed binding site consists of 15 bp with a direct spaced repeat |CITS:[15728117][10216875]|. It has been suggested that multimerization, induced by phosphorylation, is a prerequisite for binding |CITS:[11527965]|. ArcA represses transcription by directly binding to the promoter or by binding to sites overlapping an activator-binding site |CITS:[16849788][15252051]|. As an activator it  appears to act as part of a nucleoprotein complex. For activation of <i>pfl</i> a functional interaction between the ArcA and Fnr protein has been suggested |CITS:[1592804]|. For expression of <i>cydAB</i> it has been shown that ArcA-P antagonizes H-NS |CITS:[11123679]|. At the R1 P<sub>Y</sub> promoter, ArcA acts in conjunction with TraJ.

COMMENT - AtoC, also known as antizyme protein (Az), is a protein that regulates processes at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels |CITS:[15200682]|. It inhibits posttranslationally ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) |CITS:[15200682]|, which is a key enzyme for biosynthesis of the polyamines which are essential components for cellular growth and proliferation |CITS:[3157043]|. On the other hand, in the presence of acetoacetate, AtoC regulates the transcription of the <i>atoDAEB</i> operon |CITS:[17616594][2883171]|, whose products are  involved in catabolism of short-chain fatty acids |CITS:[4563344]|. However, transcriptome analyses have shown that this protein not only regulates this operon but also upregulates or downregulates  11 and 32 genes, respectively, that are involved in flagellar synthesis |CITS:[12366850]|. On the other hand,  phenotypical analysis with an AtoS mutant showed reduced motility, sodium chloride sensitivity, and increased susceptibility to membrane-acting agents and an aminoglycoside antibiotic |CITS:[ 12897016]|. 
/
/Through <i>atoDAEB</i> operon regulation, AtoC modules positively the biosynthesis and the intracellular distribution of poly-(<i>R</i>)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB), a biopolymer with many physiological roles |CITS:[16564134]|. The products of the catabolism of short-chain fatty acids appear to be the substrates in the biosynthesis of this polymer |CITS:[16564134]|. By an unknown mechanism, histamine and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> appear to be signals that modulate AtoS/AtoC-dependent cPHB production |CITS:[ 18235991][ 18855762]|.
/
/AtoC is the response regulator in the two-component regulatory system AtoC/AtoS |CITS:[ 16153782]|. Autophosphorylation of AtoS appears to be stimulated by acetoacetate or one of its metabolic products |CITS:[16564134]|. Then, the phosphate group is transferred from AtoS to the D55 residue of AtoC to activate this protein |CITS:[17537579][16153782]|. It has also been suggested that the D55 residue could transfer the phosphate group to the H73 residue of AtoC |CITS:[17537579]|.
/
/AtoC belongs to the NtrC-NifA family of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase transcriptional activators |CITS:[17537579]| and, as for a number of  members of this family, AtoC  contains three domains: the N-terminal receiver domain to be phosphorylated, the central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, and the DNA-binding C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif  |CITS:[17537579]|.
/
/It was suggested that AtoC oligomerizes, but the stoichiometry is unknown |CITS:[15200682]|. This protein recognizes and binds a sequence of 20 bp in DNA |CITS:[17616594]|. In the <i>atoDAEB</i> regulatory region there are two of these sites arranged as inverted repeats separated by 1 bp |CITS:[17616594]|.  However, a BLAST analysis showed that although there are several regions with significant homology to the 20-bp AtoC-binding site, they are not arranged as palindromes |CITS:[17616594]|. AtoC-dependent <i>atoDAEB</i> transcription requires the presence and binding of IHF |CITS:[17616594]|.
/
/Proteins with antizyme activity have been found in several organisms, from plants to eubacteria |CITS:[15200682]|. A BLAST analysis showed AtoC is homologous in proteobacteria,  enterobacteria, eubacteria, and spirochetes |CITS:[15200682]|.
/
/<i>atoC</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>atoS</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, are located in the genome upstream of the <i>atoDAEB</i> operon |CITS:[3025185]|. The transcription of the gene <i>atoC</i> is induced by polyamines |CITS:[17224065]| and histamine |CITS:[ 18235991]|; microarray analysis shows that OmpR may regulate the transcription of this gene |CITS:[ 12366850]|.  On the other hand, it does not appear to be autoregulated |CITS:[2883171]|.

COMMENT - CreB "<i><b>C</i></b>arbon source <i><b>re</i></b>sponsive response regulator," is a DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator |CITS:[11350954][18375564]| and belongs to the CreBC two-component system (TCS) |CITS:[2228961][11350954][18375564]|, which controls genes involved in acetate |CITS:[7883769]| and ribose |CITS:[10542272]| metabolism, in the maltose regulon |CITS:[ 9000616]|, in the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS:[8572885]|, and genes which repair DNA damage associated with the replication fork |CITS:[10224240]|. 
/
/CreBC regulates the expression of cre regulon genes in response to a switch from complex to minimal medium |CITS:[11350954]|. It is active when cells are fermenting glycolytic carbon sources. Induction of the cre regulon during pyruvate growth is entirely CreC dependent |CITS:[18375564]|.
/
/CreBC is considered a global regulator that is positioned at the heart of metabolic control |CITS:[11350954]|.
/
/CreB and CreC are part of the <i>creABCD</i> operon |CITS:[18375564]|. CreB binds <i>in vitro</i> to a TTCACnnnnnnTTCAC sequence called the cre tag direct repeat, which stimulates the cre regulon |CITS:[18375564]|.
/
/CreBC (TCS) is homologous (60-70%) with BrlAB of <i>Aeromonas</i> spp. at the amino acid level |CITS:[11350954]|.
/
/CreC can act as the the phosphate donor for PhoB in PhoR mutants (|CITS:[11350954]| and references therein) but this activity is masked in PhoR<sup>+</sup> strains and the CreC/PhoB pathway is not responsive to phosphate levels |CITS: [7021308]|.  
/
/A model of regulation by CreBC was proposed by Cariss et al. (2008) in which CreC responds to changes in the growth medium and/or signal and autophosphorylates; later, its phosphate is passed on to CreB, which binds to cre tag sequences. CreB functions as a transcriptional activator by recruiting RNA polymerase, whereas the binding of CreB to the cre tag represses transcription through promoter occlusion |CITS:[18375564]|.

COMMENT - CitB/DpiA is a dual transcriptional regulator involved in anaerobic citrate catabolism. In the presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation, the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon, the <i>citAB</i> operon, and <i>mdh</i>, as well as the <i>exuTR</i> operon for dissimilation of hexuronate |CITS:[18997424]|. 
/
/Due to the ability of CitB/DpiA to bind to A/T-rich sequences, multiple other roles have been assigned to CitB. When overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i>, it destabilizes plasmid inheritance, represses transcription of <i>appY</i>, encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism, and induces the SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to A/T-rich sequences at the replication origin |CITS: [9701802][14526013]|. Moreover, inactivation of penicillin-binding protein 3, FtsI, either chemically or genetically, induces SOS in <i>E. coli</i>. This induction requires <i>dpiBA</i> |CITS:[15308764]|. 
/
/CitB/DpiA belongs to the two-component system DpiB/DpiA, or CitBA. The operon containing both genes, <i>citB</i> (<i>dpiA</i>), encoding the response regulator, and <i>citA</i> (<i>dpiB</i>), encoding the sensor kinase, is transcribed divergently to the <i>citCDEFXGT</i> operon. CitA (DpiB) binds citrate with its periplasmic domain |CITS:[11889485]| and senses reduced conditions using a single Cys residue <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[19202292]|. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to CitB (DpiA) |CITS:[19202292]|. Therefore, it has been suggested that the main role of DpiA/CitB is regulation of citrate fermentation |CITS:[11889485]|.
/
/CitB/DpiA shows 47% similarity to the CitB protein from <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, which also controls the citrate fermentation process |CITS:[9701802]|. Like CitB from <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, CitB/DpiA from <i>E. coli</i> contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif in the C-terminal domain and three well-conserved residues, two aspartates (positions 13 and 57) and one lysine (position 107), in the N-terminal domain |CITS: [9701802]|. CitB/DpiA binds to sequences with a very high A + T content |CITS:[9223636][19202292]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional activator EvgA initiates a complex activation cascade for gene products involved in acid resistance and multidrug resistance |CITS:[19352034][14523115][15489450][12670992][12399493][15494746]|.
/
/It directly activates at least six operons, among which the <i>b1500-ydeO</i> operon encodes two additional activator proteins. B1500 is the connector protein for the PhoPQ two-component system, which is involved in acid resistance and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis |CITS:[17998538]|. YdeO is an AraC-like transcriptional activator for at least 12 operons, including the <i>gadE-mdtE-mdtF</i> operon |CITS:[19329985][19329985][12694615][11282467]|. <i>mdtEF</i> encodes a multidrug efflux pump, and <i>gadE</i> encodes the master regulator for glutamate-dependent acid resistance |CITS:[12940989][19220752]|. GadE activates transcription of two additional AraC-like transcriptional activators, GadX and GadW. The EvgA-YdeO-GadE circuit is very complex and involves feedback loops and autoactivation |CITS:[15489450][19352034][17660422]|. It is activated during exponential growth in acidified minimal medium and enables the cell to survive gastric acidity.
/
/EvgA belongs to the two-component system EvgS/EvgA |CITS:[1289796]|, which is highly homologous to the virulence-related BvgAS system of <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>. The sensor kinase EvgS carries an N-terminal periplasmic domain and three cytoplasmic domains, a transmitter, a receiver, and a phosphotransfer (HPt) domain. EvgA is a member of the NarL subfamily of response regulators, consisting of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Like BvgA, EvgA presumably is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain to the receiver and Hpt domain of EvgS and finally to the receiver domain of EvgA |CITS:[9501520][11111905][9535079]|.
/
/An 18-bp inverted repeat motif was proposed as the EvgA DNA-binding site |CITS:[12399493][14523115]|.

COMMENT - ZraR, "<b>z</b>inc<b> r</b>esistance-<b>a</b>ssociated <b>r</b>egulator," controls the expression of genes involved in tolerance to high zinc concentrations. ZraR recognizes a DNA sequence of two inverted repeats of 16 bp separated by 14 bp |CITS:[11243806]|.
/
/This regulator is a member of the two-component regulatory system ZraS/ZraR. The operon containing both genes <i>zraR</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>zraS</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, is located next to and in the opposite direction to <i>zraP </i>, a gene regulated by ZraR. It has been suggested that ZraS  functions as a zinc receptor |CITS:[11243806]|. ZraS and ZraR show considerable homology with the proteins NtrB and NtrC, respectively |CITS:[2666400]|.
/
/ZraR also belongs to the group of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcriptional regulators |CITS:[11243806]|. Members of this group contain three domains: the sensory domain located in the N terminus, the central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, and the C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif |CITS:[16005641][2666400]|.
/
/A regulatory role related to the activity of the enzyme hydrogenase 3 has been assigned to ZraR (previously called HydG) |CITS:[2666400]|, but it was demonstrated that this regulation was nonspecific |CITS:[11243806]|.	
/
/Based on a crystal structure of ZraR from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium,  it has been suggested that this protein may function as a dodecamer |CITS:[16005641]|.

COMMENT - NarL, "nitrate/nitrite response regulator NarL," is a transcriptional dual regulator of many anaerobic electron transport and fermentation-related genes in the response to the availability of high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite |CITS:[9230919][7855431]|. NarL activates expression of 51 operons in response to nitrate, mostly genes needed for nitrate respiration. NarL represses 41 operons involved in alternative respiratory pathways, such as fumarate reduction or fermentation of simple sugars |CITS:[ 16377617]|.
/
/The response regulator NarL belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family |CITS:[2559300][2314271]| and is part of the two-component system NarX-NarL. There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarQ-NarP |CITS:[12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarX and NarQ, is able to phosphorylate NarL and NarP, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS:[8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarL-P is only desphosphorylated by NarX. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, NarX phosphorylates NarP but acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS:[9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, NarL mainly serves as a nitrate regulator and is only weakly phosphorylated in the presence of nitrite |CITS:[10464202][10542156]|.
/
/NarL consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The crystal structures of the monomeric full-length protein |CITS:[8780507][9521685]| and of the dimeric output domain bound to DNA |CITS:[12352954][16262254]| have been solved. In unphosphorylated NarL, the DNA-binding site of the output domain is blocked by the receiver domain |CITS:[8780507]|. Phosphorylation induces the separation of both domains, resulting in the exposure of previously inaccessible DNA-binding residues and the formation of a new dimerization interface in the C-terminal domain |CITS:[12484754][12614149]|.

/The NarL consensus recognition sequence consists of a 7-bp element, termed the NarL heptamer |CITS:[8437517][8736541]|. A subset of NarL-binding sites, in which two inverted repeats of the heptamer are separated by 2 bp (termed 7-2-7 sites), also represents binding sites for NarP |CITS:[9302020][7854119]|. Therefore, the NarL and NarP regulons overlap. NarL-binding heptamers are found as single copies, inverted repeats, or direct repeats at positions between +20 and -200 relative to the transcriptional start sites |CITS:[7643383]|. Most NarL-dependent promoters are also codependent on the oxygen sensor FNR, IHF, or Fis, implying that multiprotein complexes are involved in the transcriptional regulation of NarL target promoters |CITS:[16936015][9484902][10972841][15225315][11929525]|.

COMMENT - NarP, "nitrate/nitrite response regulator NarP," is a transcriptional dual regulator of many anaerobic electron transport and fermentation-related genes in the response to the availability of high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite |CITS:[9230919][7855431]|. A microarray analysis suggests that NarP activates 14 operons and represses 37 operons |CITS:[16377617][16417494]|.
/
/The response regulator NarP belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family |CITS:[2559300][2314271]| and is part of the two-component system NarQ-NarP. There is intensive cross-regulation with the paralogous two-component system NarX-NarL |CITS:[12546643][8501030]|. Each of the sensors, NarQ and NarX, phosphorylates both NarP and NarL, leading to the activation of both proteins. In the absence of nitrate and nitrite, NarX and NarQ stimulate the dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P |CITS:[8051011][8473280]|. This reaction is specific, that is, NarP-P is only dephosphorylated by NarQ. The system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite. In the presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to the same extent. In the presence of nitrite, autophosphorylation of NarX is low and NarX acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P |CITS:[9426129][9006026][10464202]|. In contrast, NarQ phosphorylates NarL and NarP in response to both nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, with nitrite, NarP-P is the major regulator, and with nitrate both NarL and NarP are functional |CITS:[10464202][10542156]|.
/
/NarP consists of the N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. NarP is 44% homologous to NarL, the structure of which has been solved by X-ray crystallography |CITS:[8780507][9521685]|. NarL and NarP work together in the regulation of gene expression. NarP binds to two inverted heptamers separated by 2 bp, termed 7-2-7 sites |CITS:[9302020][7854119]|. The binding sites for NarP overlap with the binding sites for NarL. However, for NarL the presence of one heptamer is sufficient for binding |CITS:[8437517][8736541]|. The location and spacing of the binding sites vary considerably in different promoters, and most promoters are also codependent on additional regulators, e.g., the oxygen sensor FNR, IHF, or Fis |CITS:[16936015][9484902]|. 
/
/NarP acts as a repressor or activator of gene expression, or it interferes with other regulatory proteins bound near the promoter. For example, expression of <i>nrf</i> is activated by FNR and repressed by IHF and Fis. NarL and NarP act as antirepressors. In the presence of nitrate or nitrite NarL or NarP binds to a target site upstream of the binding sites for FNR, IHF, and Fis, counteracting the effect of IHF but not that of Fis. Similarly, activation of <i>nir</i> by FNR is suppressed by IHF, Fis, and H-NS. NarL or NarP counteracts repression by Fis and IHF, but not repression by H-NS |CITS:[10972841][16936015][15978080][10972841]|. Expression of the <i>napF</i> operon is induced by NarP in the presence of FNR. NarL can displace NarP but is unable to activate transcription from this location |CITS:[9696769][7643383]|. The <i>ydh</i> operon is activated by FNR and suppressed by NarP and NarL. It has been suggested that NarL is responsible for nitrate-mediated repression and NarP is responsible for nitrite-mediated repression of <i>ydh</i>, and both compete with RNA polymerase for binding at the promoter |CITS:[18227264]|.

COMMENT - The response regulator OmpR, for "<b>O</b>uter <b>m</b>embrane <b>p</b>rotein <b>R</b>egulator," |CITS:[6263866][7042694][17628138]|, belongs to the two-component system EnvZ/OmpR |CITS:[1700256][1311295][1618729][7855421][10192921] [10947842][11973328][12077136][12453214][15979641][16553882][12453215]|. EnvZ is an osmosensor histidine kinase and is known to be a transmembrane protein composed of three domains: an external sensory domain (amino terminal), a cytoplasmic transmitter domain (carboxyl terminal), and a transmembrane hydrophobic central domain |CITS:[2668953][9070221][15357641]|. The sensor domain responds to changes in extracellular osmolarity. EnvZ and OmpR comprise a signal transduction system where the signal generated by the periplasmic receptor affects through a protein-protein interaction the EnvZ cytoplasmic component, which is transmitted via phosphorylation from autophosphorylating histidine kinase to the response regulator OmpR |CITS:[1657696][1700256][1311295][1618729] [7855421][10192921][10760160][12453214][15979641][11934608][11158569][12453215]|. 
/
/Phosphorylated OmpR controls the transcriptional expression of several genes and operons  whose products are involved  in adaptation to changes in osmolarity, such as major outer membrane porins |CITS: [3157679][3010044][3294816][1741624][1769957][1618729] [8876642][11973328][16618701]|, and negatively regulates the expression of flagella |CITS:[7642497]|, promotes biofilm formation |CITS:[11717281]|, increases curli genes expression |CITS:[9573197][15743952]|, increases expression of several drug exporter genes |CITS:[12618449]|, and confers increased beta-lactam resistance |CITS:[12951338]|, among other effects |CITS:[1695892][10802181][15175316][18953042]|.
/
/This protein consists of two functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated, and the C-terminal output domain, which binds to DNA and interacts with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS:[1321117][7565603][7568033][8989318][9016718][12077136][15979641][12077136] [15979641][8989318]|. The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors |CITS:[8989318][9016718]|. Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain, and phosphorylation relieves inhibition. The crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain has been determined |CITS:[9016718][8989318]|.
/
/
/This regulator binds in tandem to sequences that are 20 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs composed of two 10-bp repetitive subsites; each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[1769957][1321117][8876642][16618701][11934608][16618701] [8175665][9878429]|. A model of regulation that explains the differential expression of porin genes has been described |CITS:[11934608][16618701][9422609][1648075][8175665]|. In high osmolarity <i>ompF</i> is repressed by DNA looping while the <i>ompC</i> gene is expressed, but under low osmolarity the expression of these genes is inverted.
/
/The cross-regulation of OmpR by CpxA, ArcB, or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of OmpR in response to different conditions |CITS:[10947842][18761686][10192921]|.

COMMENT - PhoB is a dual transcription regulator that activates expression of the Pho regulon in response to environmental P<sub>i</sub>. The Pho regulon includes operons and genes whose products are involved in phosphorus uptake and metabolism |CITS:[8432742][8755861][17020555]|. Expression of the periplasmic binding proteins for peptide transport, OppA and DppA, is repressed by PhoB |CITS:[1478454]|.  
/
/PhoB is a response regulator and belongs to the two-component system PhoR/PhoB. Under phosphate limitation conditions the inner membrane sensor kinase PhoR autophosphorylates. Subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to PhoB results in activation of PhoB |CITS:[2693738]|. When phosphate is in excess, autophosphorylation of PhoR is inhibited and PhoB-P is dephosphorylated. This negative regulation requires in addition to PhoR an intact Pst system and PhoU |CITS:[8691745]|. In the absence of PhoR, cross-regulation of PhoB by CreC or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of PhoB in response to carbon sources |CITS:[1551836][2228961]|. 
/
/PhoB consists of two functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated, and the C-terminal output domain, which binds to DNA and interacts with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS:[8648643][8422984]|. The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors |CITS:[9199401]|. Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain, and phosphorylation relieves inhibition |CITS:[11073900]|. 
/
/PhoB binds to the Pho box, which has been described as two direct 11-bp repeats consisting of successive 7-bp direct repeats followed by an A/T-rich region of 4 bp, situated 10 bp upstream of the -10 region |CITS:[3054125][12015152][3537313]|. The <i>pho</i> promoters contain functional  -10 sequences but lack the consensus  -35 sequence |CITS:[2651888]|.
/
/The 3D structures of the receiver domain in the absence and presence of the phosphoryl analog beryllium fluoride |CITS:[16154092][9878437]|, and of two constitutively active mutants of this domain |CITS:[17182055]|, have been solved. The data reveal that the active and inactive receiver domains dimerize in two different orientations relative to each other. Also, the 3D structures of the output domain without DNA |CITS:[10653699]| and in complex with its target DNA have been solved |CITS:[12015152]|. These data reveal that the output domains bind in a novel tandem arrangement, in which several monomers bind head to tail to successive 11-bp direct repeat sequences, coating one face of the double helix |CITS:[12015152]|. In addition, a hybrid protein, in which the receiver domain has been replaced by a leucine zipper, is active <i>in vivo</i> as a transcriptional activator |CITS:[19371748]|. 
/
/Taken together these data suggest that PhoB is activated through an intermolecular mechanism. In unphosphorylated PhoB the output domains are constrained. Phosphorylation changes the relative orientation of the subunits to each other, such that orientational constraints between the output domains are lost, allowing the tandem head-to-tail orientation for the active conformation |CITS:[16154092][19371748][12015152]|.

COMMENT - PhoP is a dual transcriptional regulator that is activated in response to low extracellular levels of divalent cations, e.g., magnesium or calcium |CITS:[1530848][1729240][10464230]|. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12, PhoP activates transcription of a large collection of genes involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, acid resistance, and LPS modification |CITS:[10464230][12813061][17909183]|.
/
/PhoP belongs to the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators characterized by a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. The structure of the N-terminal receiver domain has been solved in the absence and presence of the phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride |CITS:[17545283]|. PhoP is phosphorylated and thereby activated by its cognate sensor kinase PhoQ at a low extracellular concentration of magnesium. At high levels of magnesium the phospho-PhoP phosphatase activity of the sensor protein is induced |CITS:[10807931]|.
/
/Regulation of the PhoQ/PhoP system is connected to the EvgS/EvgA system through the small inner membrane protein B1500.

COMMENT - RstA appears to control genes involved in different biological processes, such as acid tolerance,  curli fimbria formation, and anaerobic respiration, among others |CITS:[ 17468243]|. Some phenotypes caused by RstA have been identified by mutational analysis. For example, RstA is a suppressor of a lesion in <i>yjeE</i>, a gene essential for cell growth and whose cellular function is unknown |CITS:[17293428]|. RstA overproduction causes drug resistance |CITS:[12618449][12951338 ]|. 
/
/RstA belongs to the two-component system RstA/RstB |CITS:[15522865]|. Both genes, <i>rstA</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>rstB</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, are transcribed together in an operon that is induced under low-Mg<sup>2+</sup> growth conditions through the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system |CITS:[ 12813061]|. The autophosphorylation of RstB appears to be stimulated by low pH |CITS:[17468243][15522865]|. Subsequently, the phosphate group is transferred from RstB to RstA to activate it |CITS:[15522865]|.
/
/A 14-bp DNA sequence that contains the TACA direct repeat has been identified as the RstA DNA-binding site and is called the RstA box |CITS:[ 17468243]|.

COMMENT - TorR is a transcriptional DNA-binding dual regulator |CITS:[10648521]|, being a positive regulator for genes related to TMAO (trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide) induction |CITS:[2040436][8083154]| and the enzymes of tryptophan metabolism |CITS:[12657056]| and a negative regulator of glutamate decarboxylase genes |CITS:[12657056]| and of its own expression |CITS:[8596446][10648521][10648521]|. The  autoregulation occurs in its phosphorylated, as well as unphosphorylated, form |CITS:[10648521]|; in addition, it  is TMAO independent and still occurs in a torS mutant |CITS:[10648521]|. <i>torR</i> negative autoregulation is likely to maintain the TorR concentration at a low level, whatever the growth conditions |CITS:[10648521]|. Furthermore, using a DNA array technology, seven new transcriptional units involved in alkaline stress and whose expression is under positive and negative control by the TorS/TorR phosphorelay system have been identified |CITS:[12657056]|.
/
/The <i>torR</i> gene is located just upstream of the <i>torCAD</i> operon, in the opposite transcription direction |CITS:[8083153]|. Pascal et al. (1991) proposed that <i>torR</i> encodes a positive regulator, based on work with a <i>torR</i> insertion mutant affected in the expression of the <i>torA</i> gene |CITS:[2040436]| and detection of similarities with response regulators of the two-component regulatory system |CITS:[1482126] [2556636]|. 
/
/Based on its C-terminal, TorR has been recognized as a member of the PhoB-OmpR subfamily of response regulators, which includes numerous members in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[8083154]| that regulate transcription of specific target genes at promoters which are thought to be recognized by the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> RNA polymerase holoenzyme |CITS:[8083153]|. The interaction of TorR with this region might prevent RNA polymerase binding to the torR promoter by a simple steric hindrance mechanism |CITS:[10648521]|. The response regulators possess a conserved N-terminal domain of 120-130 residues with one specific aspartyl residue that is phosphorylated by the sensor partner |CITS:[8596446]|.
/
/TorR mediates TMAO induction |CITS:[8083153]|. <i>torS</i> encodes the sensor partner of TorR. In the presence of TMAO, TorS is an unorthodox sensor that autophosphorylates, and the phosphoryl group is transferred to TorR |CITS:[8596446]| via a four-step phosphorelay, His443-Asp723-His850-Asp(TorR) |CITS:[9135110][11274133]| which, in turn, activates transcription of <i>torCAD</i> |CITS:[10648521]|. There is strong experimental evidence that TorR is dephosphorylated by TorS, using only the His850 and Asp723 residues of TorS |CITS: [11274133]|. The TorR protein can be phosphorylated by two different protein histidine kinases |CITS:[8083153]|.
/
/The proposed consensus sequence for TorR is 5'-CTGTTCATAT, which is found several times in direct repeats within the <i>tor</i> DNA regulatory region |CITS:[8596446]|. This occupation of multiple binding sites results in the formation of a nucleoprotein complex such that  TorR is positioned to exert a direct stimulatory effect on RNA polymerase |CITS:[8596446]|. TorR-binding motifs are located on the same side of the DNA helix |CITS:[8596446][10648521]|.
/
/The X-ray crystal structure of the activation by TorR involved a mechanism of dimerization using a set of highly conserved residues in the &alpha;4-&beta;5-&alpha;5 face |CITS:[16322582]|.
/
/The TorS-TorR TCS (two-component system) is involved in the activation of alkaline stress defense and represses acid stress mechanisms in order to counteract the alkalinization of the medium resulting from the reduction of TMAO to trimethylamine |CITS:[12657056]|.
/
/The <i>torR</i> gene seems to be expressed at the same low level whatever the growth conditions |CITS:[10648521]|. TorR could mediate anaerobic regulation |CITS:[8083153]|. Overproduction causes a multidrug resistance phenotype |CITS: [12618449]|.

COMMENT - Under nitrogen (N)-limiting conditions, the NtrC transcriptional dual regulator regulates genes involved  in the assimilation of nitrogen and in the minimization of the slow growth caused by the N-limited condition |CITS:[11121068]|. Through a cascade of events NtrC appears to regulate as much as 2% of the genome, and many of these genes encode transport systems for nitrogen-containing compounds |CITS:[11121068]|.
/
/NtrC belongs to the two-component system NtrB/NtrC |CITS: [12730324]| and is a member of the &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activator family, whose homologues are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS:[10779705]|. Both genes <i>glnG</i>, encoding the response regulator (NtrC, also called NRI), and <i>glnL</i>, encoding the sensor kinase (NtrB, also called NRII), are organized in the operon <i>glnALG</i>. <i>glnA</i> encodes a glutamine synthetase|CITS: [2882477]|.  In rich media, the transcription of <i>glnALG</i> is activated from the glnAp1 promoter by &sigma;<sup>70</sup> and under limiting ammonium is activated from the glnAp2 promoter by &sigma;<sup>54</sup> |CITS: [8094391]|.
/
/NtrB functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that in response to limitation of N and carbon-limited growth is autophosphorylated. After that, NtrB transfers its phosphate group to NtrC to activate this transcriptional regulator |CITS: [2858855][2848245]|. NtrB is also able to dephosphorylate to NtrC |CITS: [2858855][2848245]|. On the other hand,  NtrC is sometimes autophosphorylated with small-molecule phospho donors |CITS:[1356964]|.
/
/In the presence of N, the GlnB protein (also called PII) or the GlnK protein binds to NtrB to activate its phosphatase activity. The NtrB-GlnB/GlnK complex dephosphorylates to NtrC or inhibits NtrC autophosphorylation, inactivating it |CITS:[11063581][15317778][10074086][ 9720863 ]|.  Under N deficiency, GlnB and GlnK are uridylylated (GlnB-UMP), and in this conformation these proteins cannot bind to NtrB |CITS:[ 9720863][ 9737855 ]|. 
/
/When the NtrC is phosphorylated , the dimer, which is the inactive state of the protein, is disrupted and the ATPase domain is free to repack in the front-to-back orientation to form a hexamer or octamer ring |CITS:[16751184][14561776]|. In this ring there is contact of the receiver domain of one subunit with the ATPase domain of a second one |CITS:[16751184]|.
/
/NtrC has three domains: an N-terminal receiver domain that contains the conserved Asp-54 residue that is phosphorylated |CITS:[1321122][8407777]|; a central ATP-binding AAA+ that cleaves ATP to produce energy  used in  the process of open complex formation, mediates a phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization, and interacts with RNA polymerase  through the highly conserved GAFTGA motif |CITS:[8407777][12180911]|; and a C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding and is involved in dimerization and in phosphorylation-independent oligomerization |CITS:[ 8407777][15208307]|.
/
/The NtrC-P binds to an inverted repeat sequence that can be located at a considerable distance from the start site of transcription |CITS:[2871943][12617754]|. NtrC interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase through auxiliary DNA-binding proteins, such as FIS, via DNA looping |CITS:[16553838]|.

COMMENT - BolA regulates the transcription of genes involved in the morphology of the cell to confer protection to the cell, specifically under stress conditions and during stationary phase |CITS:[ 12354237][ 19111750]|.  Its overexpression produces round-shaped cells, alters elongation and cell septation |CITS:[3053647][12354237]|, induces biofilm formation |CITS:[15345459]|, and alters the properties of the outer membrane |CITS:[16790025]|. Under poor growth conditions, BolA is essential for normal cell morphology during both the exponential and stationary growth phases and in response to sudden carbon starvation |CITS:[12354237 ]|. 
/
/The transcription expression analysis of some genes with BolA mutants and the presence of a putative helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding suggest that BolA is a transcriptional regulator, although its regulatory mechanism and specific DNA-binding site remain to be determined |CITS:[ 2684651]|. On the other hand, structural, sequence, and physical interaction analyses show that BolA could be a reductase that interacts with glutaredoxin |CITS:[ 15670813]|.
/
/BolA is a member of the BolA family, which is widely distributed among proteobacteria and eukaryotes |CITS:[ 15670813]|. 
/
/The expression of <i>bolA</i> is regulated at the transcriptional level and at posttranscriptional levels.  Its transcription is induced under stationary phase |CITS:[ 1648559]| and under different stress conditions, such as carbon starvation, osmotic stress, heat shock, acidic stress, and oxidative stress |CITS:[10361282]|. On the other hand, <i>bolA</i> mRNA stability during glucose starvation is enhanced in the presence of RNase III function |CITS:[16309817]|.

COMMENT - "<b>Ch</b>ito<b>b</b>iose regulator," ChbR, is a dual transcriptional factor that regulates an operon (<i>chb</i>) involved in transport and degradation of the &beta;-glucoside <i>N,N</i>'-diacetylchitobiose (chitobiose) |CITS:[2179048][2179047][10913119]|. ChbR is encoded within the <i>chb</i> operon itself. In the presence of chitibiose, ChbR binds to two direct repeat located between two NagC binding sites and activates the transcription of the <i>chb</i> operon by overlapping the -35 box of <i>chbB</i>p |CITS:[15066032][2179047]|. In the absence of chitobiose, ChbR acts as a repressor of the <i>chb</i> operon |CITS:[2179047][15066032]|.
/
/Parker et al. defined in 1990 the <i>chb</i> operon for a cellobiose degradation system as cryptic, because it requires a mutation in <i>chbR</i> for its activation |CITS:[9409145] [2179047][2179048]|. ChbR belongs to the AraC/XylS family |CITS:[9409145]| .

COMMON-NAME - RelB Qin prophage; antitoxin of the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system and DNA binding transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - 326765
CITATIONS - 3019679
COMMENT - RelB is the antitoxin of the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system |CITS: [9767574]|.  RelB also represses transcription of relBEF |CITS: [9767574]|.  The RelE toxin inhibits protein translation by catalyzing cleavage of mRNA in the A site of the ribosome |CITS: [12526800]|. RelB production relieves established RelE-mediated translation inhibition and inhibition of cell growth, indicating that growth inhibition is not irreversible |CITS: [12123459]|.  The activity of tmRNA, SsrA, counteracts RelE-mediated translation inhibition |CITS: [12526800], [12787364]|.    
/
/The RelE-RelB system is involved in regulation of cell growth under conditions with limited nutrients |CITS: [342488], [6162075], [11717402], [12526800], [12787364]|.  
/
/RelE and RelB exhibit a physical interaction, and RelE physically interacts with ribosomes |CITS: [11274135]|.
/
/RelB has similarity to proteins from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, and <i>E. coli</i> plasmid P307 |CITS: [9767574], [9917385]|.  The RelE-RelB system exhibits activity when produced exogenously in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [11097943]|. 
/
/Regulation has been described |CITS: [2990907], [11717402]|.  When cells are starved of amino acids, Lon protease degrades RelB; RelB degradation derepresses transcription of relBE; RelE accumulates in excess compared with its RelB antitoxin; and this free RelE causes translation inhibition |CITS: [11717402]|.

COMMENT - PdhR, "<b>p</b>yruvate <b>d</b>e<b>h</b>ydrogenase complex <b>r</b>egulator," regulates genes involved in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex |CITS:[7783622][8262214][10972807]|. 
/
/Activity of PdhR is controlled by pyruvate. In the absence of this compound, the PdhR regulator binds to its target promoters. This repression is antagonized by its coeffector, pyruvate |CITS:[7783622][17513468]|. In addition to the role described above, PdhR also controls the synthesis of two key enzymes (Ndh and CyoA) in the terminal electron transport system |CITS:[17513468]|.
/
/The PdhR belongs to the GntR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which share sequence similarities in their N-terminal DNA-binding domains |CITS:[2060763][8407843]|. PdhR is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[2548486]|.

COMMENT - FabR, "<b>F</b>atty <b>a</b>cid <b>b</b>iosynthesis <b>R</b>egulator," represses expression of the <i>fabA</i> and <i>fabB</i> genes, which are essential for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids |CITS:[12440970][11859088]|. FabR directly influences membrane lipid homeostasis |CITS:[12440970][11859088][1100043]|. It is a unique example of a transcription factor exclusively regulating expression of type II fatty acid synthase enzymes |CITS:[11859088]|. 
/
/The FabR consensus sequence has been identified as a palindromic sequence with a length of 18 bp |CITS:[11859088][11160901]|. DNA binding and repression require the binding of unsaturated acyl-ACP (acyl-acyl carrier protein) or acyl-CoA. Saturated acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA competes with the unsaturated fatty acids for binding to FabR but does not trigger DNA binding |CITS:[19854834]|. Thus, FabR senses the ratio, rather than the absolute amount, of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and adjusts expression of <i>fabA</i> and <i>fabB</i> to balance the composition of saturated and unsaturated acyl-ACP |CITS:[19854834]|.
/
/The binding site for FabR overlaps with the binding site for FadR, the transcriptional activator for <i>fabA</i> and <i>fabB</i> in the promoter regions of both <i>fabA</i> and <i>fabB</i>. Both regulators can bind simultaneously to the promoter of <i>fabB</i> in the presence of unsaturated acyl-ACP |CITS:[19854834]|.
/
/FabR belongs to the TetR family |CITS:[15944459][11160901][10592242]| and has a helix-turn-helix motif at the N terminus typical of repressors |CITS:[10734204]|. Homologs of FabR are found exclusively in &gamma;-protobacteria |CITS:[11160901]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional activator GadE, for "<b>G</b>lutamic <b>a</b>cid <b>d</b>ecarboxylase," is positively autoregulated |CITS:[15489450][14702398]| and controls the transcription of genes involved in the maintenance of pH homeostasis, including the principal acid resistance system |CITS:[12686161][11976288][11555293][14702398][12940989][12399493][12694615][12426343]|, glutamate dependent (GAD), also referred as the GAD system, and genes involved in multidrug efflux, among others |CITS:[12446650][18808381][12730179][16980449][18297445][14702398]|. GadE also controls the expression of two transcription factors related to acid resistance, GadW and GadX, and for this reason it is considered the central activator of the acid response system |CITS:[14702398][12940989]|. GadE is encoded by the <i>gadE-mdtEF</i> operon, inducible by low pH |CITS:[12426343]|, which is located in the region called the acid fitness island |CITS:[18808381]|. Expression of <i>gadE</i> is controlled by an unusually large 798-bp upstream intergenic region, termed the sensory integration locus |CITS:[19220752]|. At least six regulators related to the acid resistance system, GadE, GadX, GadW, EvgA, YdeO, and MnmE, are involved in the direct regulation of <i>gadE</i> |CITS:[19220752][17660422][14702398]|.
/
/Ma et al. proposed that the binding targets for GadE consist of 20-nucleotide sequences that possess nonconserved motifs, called the GAD box, and suggested that it is a regulator that may form a complex with GadX |CITS:[12940989]|. 
/
/As a member of the LysR family, this transcription factor is composed of two domains: the N-terminal domain, which has a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif in the DNA-binding region, and the C-terminal inducer-binding domain |CITS:[16218453][8257110]|.

COMMON-NAME - H-NS-like DNA-binding protein with RNA chaperone activity
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3328298123:keseler
COMMENT - StpA protein for "<b>S</b>uppressor of <b>t</b><i>d</i>- <b>p</b>henotype <b>A</b>," is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein |CITS:[10551881][10947847]| that acts as a transcriptional repressor |CITS:[16980475]| and as a chaperone |CITS:[17267410][15849314]|.  This protein is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[16980475]| and it is involved in the -glucoside utilization systems |CITS:[16980475][11737635][9473058]| and the homologous recombination and repair of bleomycin damage |CITS:[17991999]|. Gueun et al. suggested that StpA may regulate the expression of a tributyltin-inducible operon |CITS:[18245262]|.  Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature. New genes may be identified by high-throughput analysis |CITS:[19151137]|.
/
/It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to H-NS |CITS:[7961433][1480493]|, and these two proteins can have similar functions |CITS:[10515926][10947847]|. It has an approximately fivefold-greater affinity for DNA than H-NS and has a preference for curved DNA |CITS:[11278075]|. This regulator binds curved DNA, in the promoter region, with AT-rich motifs, and StpA binds to sites that have poorly related sequences and it does not have a consensus sequence for the DNA binding. 
/
/Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an </i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but their specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS:[7961433][11278075][8890170][8635467][19151137][8890170]|. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also there exists evidence that some of these proteins can form homodimers |CITS:[11244076][8755860][10203842][8755860]|. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner |CITS:[11244076][10485902]|; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by direct interaction between StpA and H-NS |CITS:[11244076]|. On the other hand StpA may form heteromeric complexes with Hha and YdgT |CITS:[15458420]|. 
/
/StpA consists of two structured domains which are separated by a protease-sensitive linker |CITS:[9643551]|. The N-terminal domain is involved in the protein-protein interaction, while the purified C-terminal domain alone promotes annealing of RNA oligonucleotides and <i>trans</i>-splicing in vitro |CITS:[17901153][9643551][10203842][8755860]|. Repression of the <i>bglG</i> operon by StpA occurs as a molecular adapter  |CITS:[9473058][11737635]| and only in the presence of the N-terminal H-NS protein domain, which comprises the core for dimerization |CITS:[16980475]|. 
/
/StpA has RNA chaperone activity in vitro and in vivo, and the RNA chaperone activity of StpA is influenced by the structural stability of the RNA target molecule  |CITS:[17901153][8635467][7493324][10393192][12208852][12440999][15849314]|. StpA may destabilize the small regulatory RNA MicF |CITS:[11601842][11029695]|.

COMMENT - EnvR , also known as AcrS, represses the transcription of genes encoding a drug efflux pump that has a role  in resistance to antibiotics |CITS:[ 18567659]|.
/
/This protein is homologous to some other proteins, such as MtrR of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, TcmR of <i>Streptomyces glaucescens</i>, JadR2 from <i>Streptomyces venezuelae/<i>, and AcrR from <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[ 7592375][8196548]|. All of these proteins, including EnvR,  have a helix-turn-helix motif  close to the N terminus |CITS:[ 7592375][8196548]|.
/
/EnvR recognizes and binds a 24-bp palindromic DNA sequence |CITS:[ 18567659]|. The same sequence is also recognized by the transcriptional repressor AcrR  |CITS:[ 18567659]|.
/
/<i>envR</i> is adjacent and divergent  in the genome to <i>acrEF</i>, an operon that encodes another drug efflux pump; however, it is not regulated or is only lightly affected  by EnvR |CITS:[ 18567659]|. Both of these transcription units appears to be repressed by HNS |CITS:[ 18567659]|.

COMMON-NAME - LldR transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3314549729:keseler
COMMENT - LldR, formerly named "<b>l</b>a<b>ct</b>ate <b>r</b>egulator", is a transcription factor that controls expression of genes involved in transport and catabolism of L-lactate |CITS:[18263722][8407843]|. This regulator has a dual function and is positively and negatively autoregulated. In the absense of L-lactate and under anaerobic conditions, this regulator repressed the transcription of the <i>lldPRD</i> operon |CITS:[18263722]|. In this repression system, LldR binds to two operators and probably leads to repressor DNA looping |CITS:[18263722]|. Expression of this regulator is also stimulated in presence of L-lactate, and this inductor promotes a conformational change that probably destabilizes the DNA loop, promoting the transcription open complex |CITS:[18263722]|.
/
/On the another hand, the transcription of <i>lldR</i> is also induced upon biofilm formation compared to planktonic growth in both exponential and stationary phases. An <i>lctR</i> mutant is impaired in biofilm formation |CITS:[14731270]|. 
/LldR is a protein that belongs to the GntR family and, accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and oligomerization |CITS:[8407843]|.

CITATIONS - 8704970
COMMENT - AdiY is a positive DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that controls the arginine decarboxylase (<i>adi</i>) system, which is strongly induced in rich medium, under anaerobic conditions, and at low pH |CITS:[8704970][7537138]|.
/
/Several proteins are involved in the induction of the <i>adi</i> system. Changes in the external pH activate the <i>adiA</i> gene. AdiY may function directly or indirectly with CysB to increase expression of <i>adiA</i>. IHF and H-NS might modulate the bending and necessary access of the <i>adiA</i>p promoter for activation |CITS:[8704970]|. It has also been proposed that AdiY is not the only regulator of the <i>adi</i> system, but the conditions under which AdiY functions remain unknown |CITS:[12867448]|.
/
/The amino acid sequence of AdiY shows homology to members of the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[8704970][7537138]|. The C-terminal region of proteins from this family features a helix-turn-helix motif. AdiY has a putative transmembrane region, suggesting that it may be a membrane-associated protein |CITS:[8704970]|.
/
/The gene <i>adiY</i> is located downstream of <i>adiA</i> and in the same orientation |CITS:[8704970]|. The lack of an evident transcription-termination structure in the intergenic region between <i>adiY</i> and <i>adiC</i>, separated by 137 bp, suggests the possibility of both genes being part of the same operon |CITS:[8704970]|, but further studies have failed to confirm this |CITS:[12867448]|.

/MlrA is a member of the MerR family, containing the conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain present in members of this family |CITS:[11489123][20874755]|. On the other hand, its C-terminal, probably used by a yet-to-be-unidentified effector, showed no similarity to any of the hitherto-characterized MerR family members |CITS:[20874755]|.

COMMENT - The genes that the YeiL transcriptional activator regulates have not been identified yet, but it has been proposed that this protein might regulate genes involved in post-exponential-phase nitrogen starvation. A gene encoding a potential nucleoside hydrolase and transcribed divergently from <i>yeiL</i> has also been suggested to be subject to YeiL regulation |CITS: [11101674]|.
/
/YeiL, the third member of the CRP/FNR family, has the main structural elements conserved in Crp and Fnr, such as a sensory domain, an &alpha;-helix that serves as a dimer interface, and a DNA-recognition helix also found in Fnr. However, the specific residues in the helix for DNA binding are not conserved |CITS: [11101674]|.
/
/The regulatory activity of this protein has been suggested by analogy with FNR; this activity might be modulated by a sensory iron-sulfur cluster or by reversible disulfide-bond formation. Expression of <i>yeiL</i> increases during stationary phase under aerobic conditions and is positively autoregulated |CITS: [11101674]|.

COMMENT - "<b>S</b>u<b>g</b>a<b>R</b > transport-related <b>R</b>egulator" SgrR is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activates transcription of the divergent operon. This regulator coordinates the response to glucose-phosphate stress |CITS:[17209026][15522088][17383224]|. As the intracellular accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate correlates with SgrR induction, it has been proposed as its inducer |CITS:[17209026][15522088][17383224]|. Autoregulation of SgrR is not affected by phosphosugar stress |CITS:[17209026]|. In addition, the induction of <i>sgrS</i> expression by the nonmetabolizable glucose PTS substrate (+/-)-methyl glucoside is abolished in a <i>sgrR</i> mutant |CITS:[15522088]|.
/
/The SgrR protein is a member of a novel family of regulators and contains an N terminal which is characteristic of winged-helix DNA-binding transcriptional regulators and a predicted C-terminal solute-binding domain |CITS:[17209026]|.

COMMENT - NorR, "<b>NO r</b>eduction and detoxification <b>R</b>egulator," is one of several regulatory proteins, such as Fur, SoxR, and OxyR, that are involved in the response to reactive nitrogen species. Under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions it activates transcription of the <i>norVW</i> operon, encoding a nitric oxide (NO)-reducing flavorubredoxin that detoxifies NO |CITS:[16100392][14718666][12529359][11751865][12142437]|.  
/
/A <i>norR</i> mutant is completely defective with respect to anaerobic NO detoxification |CITS:[11751865]| and is sensitive to reactive nitrogen intermediates generated from nitroprusside. The <i>norR</i> gene is transcribed divergently from <i>norVW</i> and autoregulated |CITS:[16417519]|. It is activated in the absence of oxygen and by nitrite under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[12586421]|. 
/
/NorR is a &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcriptional activator |CITS:[12618438]|. It contains three domains: an N-terminal GAF (c<b>G</b>MP phosphodiesterase, <b>a</b>denylate cyclase, <b>F</b>hlA) domain that is involved in signal sensing |CITS:[16193057][12529359][11032796]|; a central catalytic AAA+ domain that is required for interacting with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> and for coupling ATP hydrolysis to promoter DNA melting by RNA polymerase; and a C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif |CITS:[18003617]|.  
/
/A mutant protein carrying a deletion of the GAF domain is constitutively active. Binding of NO relieves intramolecular repression and activates the ATPase activity of the central AAA+ domain |CITS:[18433632][16193057]|. The GAF domain contains a mononuclear nonheme iron center that binds NO reversibly |CITS:[16193057]|. Spectroscopy studies and structural modeling of the GAF domain identified five candidate ligands for the nonheme iron and suggested a model in which it is coordinated in a pseudo-octahedral environment by three aspartate residues, an arginine, and a cysteine |CITS:[18003617]|.
/
/The intergenic region of <i>norR</i> and <i>norVW</i> carries three binding sites for NorR with a symmetrical 11-bp consensus sequence |CITS:[15667300]|. These sites act as enhancer-binding sites for transcriptional activation by NorR |CITS:[15375149][15547270]|. All three sites are required for the stimulation of the ATPase activity <i>in vitro</i> and activation of <i>norV</i> expression <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[19955233]|. 
/
/Based on biochemical experiments and electron micrographs using a <i>norR</i> mutant carrying a deletion of the N-terminal domain, it has been proposed that NorR binds as a hexameric ring to DNA |CITS:[19955233]|. The data further suggest that in contrast to other enhancer-binding proteins the DNA binding <i>per se</i> induces a conformational change in NorR that promotes hexameric ring formation. Presumably the hexamer is further stabilized by additional DNA wrapped around the ring. Binding of NO to the GAF domain relieves intramolecular repression of the central domain, leading to the activation of the ATPase activity and interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> RNA polymerase |CITS:[19955233]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>acr</b>iflavine resistance <b>r</b>egulator", AcrR, regulates the expression of genes involved in multidrug transport and is classified in the nodulation-resistance division family |CITS: [8821940]|.
/
/The crystal structure of AcrR shows that this protein is folded into nine &alpha;-helices distributed in two domains: the DNA-binding domain, which forms the typical helix-turn-helix in the N-terminal domain, and the ligand-binding domain, which forms a large internal cavity for multidrug binding in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [17950313]|. Mutational analyses have been used to identify the critical role of some amino acids for AcrR activity, such as Glu-67 |CITS: [17950313]| and Arg-45 |CITS: [16189130]|.
/
/The activity of AcrR, which belongs to the TetR family, appears to be regulated by ligands such as rhodamine 6G, ethidium, and proflavin |CITS: [17644067]|. When one of these ligands is bound to the C-terminal domain of AcrR, a conformational change in the N-terminal domain releases the regulator from its DNA-binding site. It has been suggested that the three AcrR ligands bind to distinct overlapping sites |CITS: [17950313]| and that two of them (ethidium and proflavin) can be simultaneously bound in the cavity |CITS: [17644067]|. This cavity has an inner surface with negative potential and the ligands are positively charged, thus favoring the binding between them |CITS: [17950313]|.
/
/The <i>acrR</i> gene, whose expression is increased under general stress conditions |CITS: [8821940]|, is autoregulated and divergently transcribed from the <i>acrAB</i> operon. An inverted repeat sequence of 24 bp that overlaps the <i>acrAB</i> promoter has been identified as the AcrR-binding site |CITS: [17644067]|. This site is bound by two dimers of AcrR |CITS: [17950313][17644067]|.

COMMENT - LrhA, "<b>L</b>ys<b>R</b> <b>h</b>omologue <b>A</b>," regulates the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of type 1 fimbriae |CITS:[ 16207912]|. Indirectly, this protein also regulates the transcription of several genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, and flagellum synthesis by directly controlling the expression of the master regulator FlhDC |CITS:[ 12123461]|. 
/
/On the other hand, LrhA also regulates negatively and partially  the translation of <i>rpoS</i> through two mechanisms, one of which is RprA dependent and the other one is RprA independent. RprA is a small RNA that regulates positively the translation of <i>rpoS</i>. Both mechanisms of regulation require the presence of the sRNA chaperone Hfq; therefore, it was suggested that another small RNA , in addition to RprA , that regulates <i>rpoS</i> translation is regulated by LrhA |CITS:[ 16621809]|.
/
/LrhA is a protein that belongs to the LysR family and, like the members of this family,  LrhA contains three different domains: an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain for DNA binding, a coinducer recognition domain in the center of the protein, and a C-terminal domain that contains a cluster of four cysteine and  two histidine residues |CITS:[ 7565112]|. The activity of most members of this family is controlled by  small molecules; however, the effector of LrhA was not known until now |CITS:[ 12123461]|.  LrhA has high degree of homology  to HexA from <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> (64% identity ) and PecT from <i>Erwinia chrysanthemi</i> (61% identity) |CITS:[9643539][ 8626286]|.
/
/LrhA appears to recognize and bind  to a partial palindromic DNA sequence  of 13 bp that shows low similarity  to the general consensus for LysR family members |CITS:[ 12123461]|.
/
/The <i>lrhA</i> gene is transcribed alone, and it is under positive autoregulation by LrhA.  Unlike the majority of LysR-type regulators, LrhA does not regulate the expression of adjacent genes to <i>lrhA</i> |CITS:[ 12123461]|. The expression of <i>lrhA</i> is repressed by the RcsCDB phosphorelay system and by the DNA motor protein FtsK |CITS:[ 16621809]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor GadW, for "<b>G</b>lutamic <b>a</b>cid <b>d</b>ecarboxylase," is negatively autoregulated and controls the transcription of the genes involved in the principal acid resistance system, is glutamate dependent (GAD), and is also referred to as the GAD system |CITS:[12446650][18808381][12730179][16980449][17660422]|. In addition, GadW also activates the transcription of  the central activator involved in the acid response |CITS:[17660422]|. The physiological inducer is unknown. Richard et al. proposed that GadW can sense intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but the mechanism is not known |CITS:[17768258]|.
/
/GadW is one of the regulators in the acid resistance system and is encoded by the unusual <i>gadXW</i> operon, which is located in the region called the acid fitness island |CITS:[18808381]|. This operon encodes two transcriptional regulators, GadX and GadW, both of which are members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[9409145][11282467][18808381]|. 
/
/The activities of GadW and GadX are indispensable upon entry into the stationary phase in response to acid pH  |CITS:[11976288][12446650]|. In addition, Tramonti et al. provided evidence that the transcription of the <i>gadXW</i> operon is regulated to a posttranscriptional level by a <i>gadY</i> small RNA |CITS:[18808381][15466020]|.
/
/GadW is highly homologous to GadX (42%), and apparently both are capable of cross talk to regulate expression of the genes of this system |CITS:[18808381]|. Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of GadW, Tucker et al. proposed that this regulator and GadX have distinct molecular mechanisms |CITS:[12730179][16980449]|. These regulators form homodimers |CITS: [9409145]| and heterodimers |CITS:[12446650]| <i>in vivo</i>.
/
/Currently, the  GadW/GadX-dependent circuit, involved in the GAD system, is under discussion and study. Tramonti et al. showed that GadX alone activates <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters |CITS:[11976288]|; Ma et al. added to this regulatory interaction with the GadW protein, showing that it inhibits GadX and that in some cases it activates in the absence of GadX  |CITS:[12446650]|. Trucker et al. gave evidence that GadW can work as a coactivator of GadX or it can inhibit the GadX-dependent activation; they also provided evidence of more target genes for GadX/GadW regulation  |CITS:[12730179]|. Regarding these interactions, Tramonti et al. showed the direct GadX binding at promoters of the <i>gadB</i> (two sites) and <i>gadA</i> (four sites) operons |CITS:[11976288]|; also, Ma et al. showed that GadW forms a homodimer and that it also binds to the DNA of the <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters  |CITS:[12446650]|. 
/
/As a member of the AraC/XylS family, this transcription factor is composed of two domains: the C-terminal domain (60% homologous to the C terminal of GadX), which contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs in the DNA-binding region, and the amino-terminal domain (30% homologous to the N terminal of GadX), which is responsible for dimerization |CITS:[9409145][8451183][12446650]|. 
/
/Tramonti et al. speculated that GadW binds in tandem to two directed repeat sequences, in the same orientation, in the  intergenic regions to activate or repress the transcription of the genes regulated |CITS:[18808381]|. The binding targets for GadW consist of 21-nucleotide-long directed repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs, called the GAD box, which is proposed to be the binding site for GadW and GadX |CITS:[12730179][12730179][18808381]|. This proposal was not unexpected, because the identity and similarity of the C-terminal domains are 41% and 66%,  respectively |CITS:[18808381]|. Each monomer of GadW binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[18808381]|.

Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of GadX, Tucker et al. proposed that this regulator and GadW have distinct molecular mechanisms |CITS:[12730179][16980449]|. These regulators form homodimers |CITS: [9409145]| and heterodimers |CITS:[12446650]| <i>in vivo</i>.
/
/Currently, the  GadW/GadX-dependent circuit, involved in the GAD system, is under discussion and study. Tramonti et al.  showed that GadX alone activates the <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters |CITS:[11976288]|; Ma et al. added to this regulatory interaction the GadW protein, showing that it inhibits GadX and that in some cases it activates in the absence of GadX  |CITS:[12446650]|. Trucker et al. provided evidence that GadW can work as a coactivator of GadX or it can inhibit the GadX-dependent activation, along with evidence of more target genes for GadX/GadW regulation  |CITS:[12730179]|. About their interactions, Tramonti et al. showed the direct GadX binding at the promoters of the <i>gadB</i> (two sites) and <i>gadA</i> (four sites) operons |CITS:[11976288]|; also, Ma et al. showed that GadW forms a homodimer and that it also binds to the DNA of the <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i> promoters  |CITS:[12446650]|. 
/
/As a member of the AraC/XylS family, this transcription factor is composed of two domains: the C-terminal domain (60% homologous to the C terminal of GadW), which contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs in the DNA-binding region, and the amino-terminal domain (30% homologous to the N terminal of GadW), which is responsible for dimerization |CITS:[9409145][8451183][12446650]|. 
/
/Tramonti et al. speculated that GadX binds in tandem to two directed repeat sequences, in the same orientation, in the intergenic regions to activate or represses the transcription of the genes regulated |CITS:[18808381]|. The binding targets for GadX consist of 21-nucleotide-long directed repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs, called the GAD box, which is proposed to be the binding site for GadX and GadW |CITS:[12730179][12730179][18808381]|. This proposal was not unexpected, because the identity and similarity of the C-terminal domains are 41% and 66%,  respectively |CITS:[18808381]|. Each monomer of GadX binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[18808381]|.

COMMENT - YiaJ is a transcriptional repressor that negatively controls the expression of genes involved in the catabolism of the rare pentose l-lyxose |CITS:[10913096][9525947][15870475]|.
/
/YiaJ is negatively autoregulated, and coordinately represses transcription of the divergent <i>yiaK-S</i> operon, related to degradation of l-lyxose |CITS:[10913096]|. Additionally, its operon is activated by insertion of IS<i>1</i> into the <i>yiaJ</i> gene |CITS:[9525947]|. Although little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the YiaJ regulator, recently it has been demonstrated to act as a repressor by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements that overlap <i>yiaK</i>p |CITS:[10913096]|.  
/
/YiaJ shows high homology to the IclR family of regulators; it is composed of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal region featuring a second motif of unknown function |CITS:[9525947]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>C</b>arbohydrate <b>d</b>i<b>a</b>cid <b>r</b>egulator," CdaR, or "<b>s</b>ugar <b>d</b>i<b>a</b>cid regulator," SdaR, regulates genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of galactarate and glucarate, and it is also  autoregulated |CITS: [10762278]|. 
/
/SdaR responds to d-galactarate and d-glucarate, and even better to d-glycerate to activate the genes it regulates |CITS: [10762278]|. In addition, it was found that 2-O-&alpha;-mannosyl-d-glycerate (MG) can induce the SdaR regulon |CITS:[14645248]|. MG has been recognized as a protective osmolyte in hyperthermophylic prokaryotes and as a carbon source for <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[14645248]|.

COMMON-NAME - PspF transcriptional dual regulator
COMMENT - The transcription factor PspF, for "<b>P</b>hage <b>s</b>hock <b>p</b>rotein <b>F</b>," is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein required for &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcription activation |CITS:[17157497][8606168]|. This regulator activates the transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon, and it is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activated by transcription of the divergent operon <i>psp</i> |CITS:[15485810][8606168][9260970][16045605]|. The integration host factor facilitates control of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS:[9302010][9344746][15485810]|.
/
/
/The <i>psp</i> regulon is defined like the phage shock protein system, which is involved in protecting the bacterium during infectious processes |CITS:[15485810][8606168]|. The synthesis of this regulon is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown under different extracytoplasmic stress conditions and upon infection by filamentous phage (phage shock) |CITS:[1717346][16709570][9159513][16045608][16045605][1712397][9493373]|. 
/
/The activity of PspF is inhibited by PspA, which is an accessory protein that binds directly to PspF to inhibit transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon |CITS:[12079332][1717346]|. PspA inhibits PspF activity by direct interaction of the AAA+ transcription activation domain of PspF |CITS:[12079332]|. Although PspA appears to regulate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon, it does not bind to DNA , but it is necessary for repressing this regulon |CITS:[10629175]|. 
/
/On the other hand, PspB and PspC together act cooperatively to activate transcription of the <i>psp</i> regulon by blocking the interaction between PspA and PspF |CITS:[1717346][7596833]|. PspC is essential for this activation, whereas PspB is not strictly required |CITS:[1717346]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC form a complex, and PspC is required for PspA to bind to PspB |CITS:[12562786]|. PspA, PspB, and PspC are not observed to cross-link with PspD |CITS:[12562786]|. 
/
/The PspF AAA+ domain interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> in the presence of a compound that mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis |CITS:[11544185]|. The AAA+ domain may directly contact DNA while promoting open complex formation |CITS:[15333692]|. Detailed analysis of the role of the C7 and the C3 regions of PspF has been presented with respect to ATP hydrolysis, protein oligomerization, binding to the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme, and transcription activation |CITS:[12186874]|. 
/A conformational change in PspF is observed in the presence of ATP |CITS:[12186874]|. ATPase activity may result in transient presentation of the site that interacts with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> |CITS:[12601152]|. Steps leading to open complex formation at the promoter have been examined using PspF and various nucleoside analogs |CITS:[12649285]|. 
/
/Expression of <i>pspF</i> is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[9150200][8606168][9260970][9302010][9344746]|. The stability of <i>pspF</i> mRNA is enhanced by a RIB element (bacterial interspersed mosaic element) in the 3'-flanking region of the <i>pspF</i> transcript |CITS:[ 9150200 ]|.
/
/The PspF protein belongs to the enhancer-binding protein family of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators (bEBPs). PspF is composed of two domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain, common to members of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain |CITS:[8606168]|. PspF does not contain a regulatory domain typical for other pEBP proteins; instead, its activity is negatively controlled by PspA acting in <i>trans</i> |CITS:[10629175][15838051][12079332]|. 
/
/The catalytic AAA+ domain is necessary and sufficient to activate &sigma;<sup>54</sup> transcription <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Hexamerization is required for this function and does not require ATP, DNA, or the DNA-binding domain |CITS:[9878422][15111053][16973614][14659000]|. When assembled into a ring, the AAA+ domain uses the energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to remodel the &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase holoenzyme so that it can transition from the closed to the open complex. The AAA+ domain contains all conserved motifs of the AAA+ family, including Walkers A and B for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the second region of homology (SRH), which contains arginine fingers for intersubunit catalysis |CITS:[11473577][6329717][18208391]|. As a member of the bEBP family it carries two additional sequence insertions: the L1 loop containing the GAFTGA motif and the L2 loop (also termed the pre-SIi loop). The L1 loop is known to interact with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, presumably with region I of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. The GAFTGA motif is thought to communicate changes associated with ATP hydrolysis, leading to conformational rearrangements in the RNA polymerase closed complex and thereby promoting open complex formation |CITS:[17090527][15469519][19692583][12601152]|. The L2 loop is thought to coordinate movement of the L1 loop |CITS:[19486295][17242399]|.

COMMON-NAME - UxuR DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - 2823062:EV-EXP-IEP:3491256120:sgama
CITATIONS - 3083215
COMMENT - The "he<b>xu</b>ronate <b>r</b>egulator," UxuR, is a transcriptional factor. This protein negatively regulates its own synthesis, and in the absence of fructuronate it represses transcription of the cluster of operons involved in transport and degradation of the sugar acids &beta;-D-glucuronides, glucuronate, and gluconate |CITS:[6281232][7007313][11115104][15516583][3083215]|. This regulator is subject to catabolic repression in the presence of glucose and at low levels of cyclic AMP.
/
/Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of UxuR, it has been shown to act as a repressor, binding to a putative inverted repeat sequence from the <i>uid</i> operon in a cooperative process with UidR |CITS:[6353163][3079718][2823062]|. In 1986, Blanco et al. proposed that total repression of UxuR is achieved in the presence of UidR, suggesting the possibility that UxuR and UidR form a complex. Independently, each repressor binds to DNA separately |CITS: [3079718][3889544][2823062]|.
/ 
/On the other hand, UxuR is highly similar to ExuR (49% identity), and apparently both act together, capable of cross talk to regulate expression of the <i>uxuR</i> regulon |CITS: [11115104]|.
/
/UxuR is a protein that belongs to the GntR family and participates as a regulator of several genes involved in carbon uptake.

COMMENT - AllR (for "allantoin repressor") regulates several genes involved in the anaerobic utilization of allantoin as a nitrogen source |CITS:[10601204][12460564]|.
/
/At very low concentrations of glyoxylate, AllR represses transcription from <i>allA</i>p, <i>allS</i>p, and <i>gcl</i>p. A highly conserved region featuring an almost perfect palindromic sequence has been identified in <i>gcl</i>p and in the intergenic region between the divergent promoters <i>allA</i>p and <i>allS</i>p. It has been proven that AllR binds to this region, and it has been proposed that it may interfere with RNA polymerase by steric hindrance or contact inhibition, thus repressing transcription. In the presence of glyoxylate (the coeffector molecule of this regulator), DNA binding by AllR is inhibited and transcription of the allantoin regulon is derepressed |CITS:[12460564][16546208]|.
/
/AllR belongs to the IclR family. Members of this family of regulators feature a conserved domain architecture, with a DNA-binding motif in the N-terminal domain and a ligand-binding motif in the C-terminal domain. This regulator adopts a tetrameric conformation |CITS:[12460564][16546208]|.
/
/The <i>allR</i> gene is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and it is autoregulated |CITS:[16546208]|.

COMMENT - 
/YcgE functions as a repressor for genes involved in the modulation of biofilm formation and acid resistance genes |CITS:[19240136]|. Its expression is strongly induced at low temperature |CITS:[19240136][19011022][18174134]|.
/
/YcgE represses the transcription of the <i>ycgZ-ymgA-ariR-ymgC</i> operon |CITS:[19240136]|. This operon is transcribed divergently on the opposite strand, under the control of &sigma;<sup>38</sup> (rpoS) RNA polymerase |CITS: [19240136][18158297]|. Its gene products are involved in the production of colanic acid, a component of the biofilm matrix, via the Rcs phosphorelay system |CITS:[17222132][17609140][17765265][19172264]|. 
/
/YcgE binds to the promoter region of <i>ycgZ</i>. YcgF is an antagonist of YcgE. It binds to the N-terminal domain of YcgE and inhibits the DNA-binding activity of YcgE. Binding of YcgF to YcgE is stimulated by blue light |CITS:[19240136]|.

COMMON-NAME - DhaR DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator
CITATIONS - 15616579:EV-EXP-IMP:3346101741:keseler
COMMENT - "<b>D</b>i<b>h</b>ydroxy<b>a</b>cetone <b>R</b>egulator," DhaR, is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activates transcription of the divergent Dha operon (<i>dhaKLM</i>), which encodes three subunits of the dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinase |CITS:[15616579]|. 
/
/DhaR is inactivated when DnaK binds to the sensing domain of this regulator, in the absence of Dha |CITS:[15616579]|. Dephosphorylated DhaL (DhaL::ADP) is an antagonist of DhaK and also is able to form complexes with the sensing domain of DhaR. In the presence of Dha, DhaL::ADP displaces DhaK or blocks the association of the DhaK/DhaR complex and DhaR activates the transcription of the Dha operon |CITS:[15616579]|. 
/
/DhaR belongs to the family of bacterial enhancer-binding proteins which contain three domains: the sensing domain located in the N terminus, the central AAA+ domain, and the C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in the interaction with DNA. Although the C-terminal domain and the N-terminal domain from DhaR are similar to those of other members of this group, its central domain is not |CITS:[15616579]|. The central AAA+ domain does not contain the two conserved submotives in this family (ESELF and GAFTGA) responsible for interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>. As with other members of the family, the possibility exists of that this regulator activates dependent promoters of &sigma;<sup>70</sup> instead of dependent promoters of &sigma;<sup>54</sup> |CITS:[15616579]|.

COMMENT - Using particular analysis and high-throughput analysis (microarrays), it was established that LsrR regulates expression of many genes involved in several processes, such as autoinducer 2 uptake and processing |CITS:[15743955][17557827]|, biofilm architecture |CITS:[18309357][ 17557827]|, host invasion, stress responses, and foreign DNA, among others |CITS:[17557827]|. It also regulates the expression of small riboregulators |CITS:[17557827]|.
/
/LrsR pertains to the quorum-sensing system, which involves autoinducer-based bacterial cell-to-cell communication |CITS:[8288518]|. It was demonstrated in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium that LsrR directly senses and binds the molecule 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), phosphorylated |CITS:[17274596]| and dephosphorylated |CITS:[17557827]|. Distinct forms of DPD constitute the interconverting molecules family generally called autoinducer 2 (AI-2). The binding of DPD to LsrR inactivates LsrR, but phosphorylated DPD appears to specifically inactivate the action of LsrR on the expression of genes for autoinducer 2 uptake and processing (<i>lsrACDBFG-tam</i> operon) and <i>lsrR</i> itself |CITS:[17557827]|. On the other hand, it was suggested that dihydroxyacaetone phosphate inhibits binding of DPD to LsrR |CITS:[15601708]|.
/
/The <i>lsrR</i> gene is transcribed together with <i>lsrK</i> in an operon |CITS:[16321939]|, and this last gene encodes a protein that phosphorylates to DPD |CITS:[ 14622426]|. The <i>lsrRK</i> operon is transcribed divergently of the <i>lsrACDBFG-tam</i> operon, and both operons are activated by CRP and repressed by LsrR |CITS:[16321939]|.

COMMENT - The "&beta;-d-gl<b>u</b>curon<b>id</b>es <b>r</b>epressor," UidR, is a transcriptional repressor. UidR negatively regulates its own synthesis and represses transcription of the <i>uid</i> operon, which is involved in transport and degradation of &beta;-glucosides |CITS: [3934044][3079718][6353163][6276362][776934]|. This regulator is involved in the degradation of sugar acids and is subject to catabolic repression in the presence of glucose and at low levels of cyclic AMP.
/
/Although little is known about the regulating mechanism of UidR, it has been shown to act as a repressor, binding to a putative inverted repeat sequence in a cooperative process with UxuR |CITS:[6553163][3079718][2823062]|. In 1986, Blanco et al. proposed that total repression of UidR is achieved in the presence of UxuR, suggesting the possibility that UidR and UxuR form a complex. Independently, each repressor binds to DNA separately |CITS: [3079718][3889544][2823062]|.

COMMENT - "<b>N</b>-<b>e</b>thyl<b>m</b>aleimide reductase <b>r</b>epressor," |CITS: [18567656]| represses the <i>nemA</i> gene, which is involved in reductive degradation of <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and other toxic nitrous compounds, and it also represses its own expression. NemR belongs to the TetR family of HTH-type DNA-binding transcription factors |CITS:[16397293][15556475]|.
/
/NemR binds to a region 16 bp in length, and its consensus is a palindromic sequence, TAGACCnnnnGGTCTA, which is referred as the NemR box |CITS:[18567656]|. This box sequence, TAGACCnnnnGGTCTA, is close to the recognition sequence, TTGACCAnnTGGTCAA, of RutR (the RutR box). RutR can bind upstream of the <i>nemRA</i> operon; however, it does not play an important role in regulation of <i>nemRA</i> expression <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[18567656]|.
/
/Presently, the <i>nemRA</i> operon is the unique member of the NemR regulon. Based on genomic SELEX and gene expression analyses, NemR could be affecting other genes, such as <i>ydhF-ydhL, gloA, sapABCDF, yeaU, pck  yeaT</i>, and <i>yhgE</i> |CITS:[18567656]|; however, the regulation of the genes under control of NemR requires more detailed studies before it can be solved.
/
/The NemRA system plays an important role in <i>Escherichia coli</i> survival in the presence of toxic NEM, which is the inducer for depression of the <i>nemRA</i> operon |CITS:[18567656]|.
/
/The NemR regulator is controlled by alkylation of one or more of its Cys residues. NemR contains five Cys residues, at positions 70, 78, 88, 121, and 125, in a total of 199 residues. In some of these residues, NemR is controlled by alkylation |CITS:[18567656]|. The critical Cys residue(s) involved in NemR activity control remains to be identified |CITS:[18567656]|.

COMMENT - The RcnR, <b>r</b>esistance to <b>c</b>obalt and <b>n</b>ickel <b>r</b>egulator protein is an addition to the set of transcriptional metallo-regulator proteins of <i>E. coli</i> (some of the main ones are Fur, CueR, CusR, MntR, Zur, ZntR, and NikR) |CITS:[16956381]|, that regulate the transcriptional expression of a recently described efflux protein, RcnA |CITS:[15805538]|, to maintain nickel and cobalt homeostasis |CITS:[16956381][17120142]|. The homeostasis of different metals in the cell is constantly monitored, and adequate pathways are activated or repressed to keep the metals within normal levels. Specifically, when nickel and cobalt exceed the normal levels, cell growth stops |CITS:[16956381]|. 
/
/The <i>rcnR</i> gene is encoded divergently to the <i>rcnA</i> gene, which encodes an efflux protein that is involved in nickel and cobalt homeostasis |CITS:[15805538]|; it removes an excess of ions |CITS:[16956381]|. It has been proved by Koch and colleagues |CITS:[17120142]| that the <i>rcnR</i> gene is the target of Fur regulation in regard to iron levels (when iron increases, <i>rcnR</i> expression increases about 2.3-fold |CITS:[17120142]|). 
/
/The RcnR structure study showed that it has a charged N-terminal region (amino acids 1-34) followed by a highly conserved region of primarily nonpolar amino acids (35-64) that is, probably involved in binding metals. Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any &beta;-sheet |CITS:[16956381]|.

/RcnR is not similar to any other known transcriptional regulator; instead, it is homologous to other proteins whose genes are encoded next to genes encoding putative metal efflux proteins, metalloenzymes, or copper chaperones [and just a few (13%) of the homologs to cardiolipin synthases or membrane proteins] |CITS:[16956381]|. Such conserved localization with genes of metal-related functions suggests that these homologs are likely to play a regulatory role in metal homeostasis |CITS:[16956381]|. 
/
/RcnR acts as a transcriptional repressor for its divergent <i>rcnA</i> gene |CITS:[16956381]| and a weak repressor for its own expression |CITS:[19703465]|. In response to increasing concentrations of nickel or cobalt, RcnR releases the repression of <i>rcnA</i> and <i>rcnR</i> to allow its expression |CITS:[16956381][19703465]|. As <i>rcnR</i> expression is induced in response to iron even in the absence of Fur |CITS:[17120142]|, it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly. 
/
/RcnR binds to two sites in the <i>rcnA-rcnR</i>  intergenic region with the sequence TACT-G(6)-N-AGTA |CITS:[19703465][16956381]|. The TACT inverted repeats are critical for specific binding. The G-tracts provide a structural component to facilitate binding of RcnR to DNA, because they endow A-form DNA characteristics to the RcnR operators. In addition, RcnR interacts nonspecifically with the approximately 50 bp flanking the core binding site, resulting in DNA wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid DNA |CITS:[19703465]|. RcnR forms a stable tetramer and binds as a tetramer to one operator. The tetrameric state is not perturbed by Ni(II) or Co(II) binding |CITS:[18505253]|. 
/
/As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues |CITS:[16956381]| showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates <i>nikABCDE</i> expression and nickel uptake (for this, <i>rcnA</i> must be expressed at a basal level prior to induction, as observed with higher nickel levels) |CITS:[16956381]|. Also, RcnA is important in the modulation of the hydrogenase assembly pathway through the NikR regulation that limits nickel delivery to the process, repressing <i>nikABCDE</i> transporter expression when intracellular nickel levels are high |CITS:[16956381]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3278863360:pkarp
CITATIONS - [9387241]
COMMENT - HyfR , "<b>hy</b>drogenase <b>f</b>our <b>r</b>egulator," controls the expression of genes responsible for the proton-translocating formate hydrogenase system and for formate transport under anaerobiosis, low pH, and post-exponential growth conditions |CITS:[ 9387241]|.
/
/As a member of the group of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcriptional regulators, HyfR contains three domains: the sensory domain, located in the N terminus; the central domain, involved in open complex formation, ATP hydrolysis, and interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup>, and the C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding |CITS:[ 9387241]|. An iron-sulfur cluster and a metal cofactor (possibly a similar metal or formate) have been proposed as the signals sensed by HyfR |CITS:[12426353]|. 
/
/HyfR shows 46% identity to FhlA, a member of the same group. These proteins are dissimilar in their N-terminal regions, which in FhlA recognizes formate. However, they show only one different residue in their helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting that they recognize similar DNA-binding sites |CITS:[9387241]|.
/
/The HyfR protein is autoregulated. The gene that codes for it is the 11th in the <i>hyf</i> operon, which contains 12 genes that are not expressed at significant levels. This operon is induced under anaerobiosis, at low pH, and under fermentative conditions by formate, and it is subject to catabolite repression |CITS:[14702328][ 12426353]|.

COMMON-NAME - IscR DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator
CITATIONS - 11742080:EV-EXP-IEP:3304435469:keseler
COMMENT - The transcription factor IscR, for "<b>I</b>ron-<b>s</b>ulfur <b>c</b>luster <b>R</b>egulator," is negatively autoregulated, and it contains an iron-sulfur cluster that could act as a sensor of iron-sulfur cluster assembly |CITS:[11742080][16677314]|. This protein regulates the expression of the operons that encode components of a secondary pathway of iron-sulfur cluster assembly, iron-sulfur proteins, anaerobic respiration enzymes, and biofilm formation |CITS:[11432781][11742080][16677314][18849427][16824106][19074392]|.
/
/IscR is a member of the Rrf2 family |CITS:[19361432]| and carries a predicted N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and three conserved cysteines in its C terminus. IscR is a dimer in solution |CITS:[19361432]|, and it contains the [2Fe-2S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster when purified under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[11742080]|.
/
/Two types of DNA-binding sites have been described for IscR: type 1 and type 2. Both sites resemble 25-bp imperfect palindromes but differ in their sequence |CITS:[16677314][19361432]|. IscR requires the iron-sulfur cluster for its activity when bound to type 1 sites. P<sub>iscR</sub> contains two type 1 sites |CITS:[16677314]|. Therefore, under conditions when Fe-S cluster assembly becomes rate limiting, levels of [2Fe-2S]-containing IscR may decrease due to a lower rate of its synthesis, thus relieving repression of the <i>iscRSUA</i> operon for the biogenesis of the iron-sulfur cluster |CITS:[11742080][11752417]|. In contrast, for the regulation of promoters containing type 2 sites, such as P<sub><i>sufA</i></sub>, the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR is dispensable |CITS:[16824106][18849427]|.
/
/IscR binds cooperatively to DNA, and four protomers bind to one palindromic site |CITS:[19361432]|.

COMMENT - The antitoxin MqsA belongs to the toxin-antitoxin system MqsR-MqsA, which controls biofilm formation and triggers programmed cell death in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [19690171]|.  <i>mqsR</i> is cotranscribed with the downstream gene <i>mqsA</i>, and their respective open reading frames are separated by 1 bp. 
/
/The toxin MqsR functions as an mRNA interferase, that is, it possesses endoribonuclease activity and cleaves mRNA at the specific sequence GCU, 5' or 3' of the G.  Elevated levels of free MqsR result in programmed cell death due to the degradation of mRNA and concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis |CITS:[19690171]|.
/
/The antitoxin MqsA has two functions.  It binds and thereby inhibits the endoribonuclease activity of MqsR.  In addition it is a DNA-binding protein, as is the case for other bacterial antitoxins.  MqsA recognizes two palindromic sites located between the promoter and the start codon of <i>mqsR</i>.  Binding to these sites is enhanced when MqsA is bound to MqsR.  Therefore, it has been suggested that MqsA and the MqsA-MqsR complex negatively autoregulate expression of the <i>mqsRA</i> operon |CITS: [19690171]|.
/
/Solution |CITS: [19636869]| and crystal structures |CITS: [20041169]| of MqsA have been solved.
/
/Both MqsR and MqsA are dimeric proteins.  Based on gel filtration experiments and in analogy to other bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, it has been proposed that the MqsA-MqsR complex consists of one MqsA dimer and two MqsR dimers |CITS:[19690171]|.

COMMENT - The genes regulated by NanR, "<b>N</b>-<b>a</b>cetyl-<b>n</b>euraminic acid <b>r</b>egulator," are involved in <i>N</i>-acetyl-neuraminic acid (or sialic acid) transport and metabolism |CITS:[12897000]| and in off-to-on switching of type 1 fimbriation. NanR is inactivated by <i>N</i>-acetyl-neuraminic acid |CITS:[15534208]|.
/
/NanR is a member of the FadR/GntR family. Members of this family have two domains, an N-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a C-terminal domain with dimerization and effector-binding motifs. Three-dimensional models of the N terminus of FadR and NanR show topological similarity and a ~26% sequence identity between them |CITS:[12897000]|.
/
/NanR regulates transcription when it binds to a region of ~30 bp that contains three conserved motifs in tandem. However, this protein can be displaced from this region by <i>N</i>-acetyl-neuraminic acid. Although it has been shown that NanR can form homodimers in solution, its DNA-binding stoichiometry is unknown. When this protein is repressing transcription, it overlaps the whole promoter region |CITS:[12897000][15534208]|.
/
/The region of 30 bp that NanR binds to is close to a Dam methylation site (GATC) |CITS:[18054045][15534208]| that appears to be necessary for induction of some genes of the NanR regulon |CITS:[12139615]|. Methylation in these sites is prevented by NanR binding |CITS:[18054045][15534208]|.

COMMENT - "<b>Al</b>lo<b>s</b>e utilization <b>r</b>egulator," AlsR, negatively controls the expression of genes involved in transport and catabolism of D-allose and low-affinity transport of D-ribose |CITS:[8576032][9401019]|. It is negatively autoregulated and coordinately represses transcription of the divergent gene <i>rpiB</i>, encoding an enzyme in the pentose pathway |CITS:[8576032]|. Synthesis of <i>alsR</i> and <i>rpiB</i> genes is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown on d-allose in the absence of glucose. Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, d-allose, binds to AlsR, liberating the repression effect caused by this protein |CITS:[9401019][10559180]|.
/
/As a member of the RpiR/YebK/YfhH family of transcriptional regulators, AlsR features an N-terminal domain containing a helix-turn-helix motif |CITS:[8576032]|. Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in the literature.

COMMON-NAME - UlaR DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - 12374842:EV-EXP-IEP:3298143042:keseler
COMMENT - UlaR is a DNA-binding transcription factor of 251 amino acids that is expressed constitutively and that coordinately represses transcription of a divergent operon (<i>ula</i>) involved in transport and utilization of L-ascorbate catabolism |CITS:[12644495][12374842][17906139][15153772]|. Synthesis of these genes is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose, and under anaerobic conditions it can ferment L-ascorbate; under aerobic conditions it is functional in the presence of casein acid hydrolysate |CITS:[14996803][11741871][17906139]|. 
/
/L-Ascorbate-6-P is the effector of the UlaR transcriptional repressor, and when this small molecule binds to UlaR, it severely impairs the formation of UlaR cognate operator sites, since they form a stable complex |CITS:[18844374]|. L-Ascorbate-6-P weakens the affinity of UlaR for DNA and displaces the UlaR oligomer state from a transcription-silencing tetrameric form to a transcription-activating dimeric form |CITS:[18844374]|. UlaR activity is also controlled by homotypic tetramer-dimer transitions regulated by L-ascorbate-6-P |CITS:[18844374]|. 
/
/UlaR binds to four inverted repeat motifs in the divergent intergenic region <i>ulaG</i>-<i>ulaA</i> and overlaps its target promoters to repress transcription by blocking the interaction of the RNA polymerase with <i>ulaG</i>p and <i>ulaA</i>p |CITS:[14996803]|. Here, the presence of L-ascorbate-6-P breaks this configuration down into DNA-free UlaR homodimers and allows transcription to proceed |CITS:[18844374]|. At concentrations of >2 nM, L-ascorbate-6-P displaces UlaR from its operator site |CITS:[18844374]|.
/
/In this system the full repression of the <i>ula</i> regulon requires IHF and binding of UlaR to four operator sites, possibly involving UlaR-mediated DNA loop formation |CITS:[14996803]|. 
/
/The UlaR transcriptional repressor belongs to the DeoR family, and accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: an N-terminal HTH domain (residues 1-62), which contains the DNA-binding region |CITS:[12374842]|, and the C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain (residues 69-251), which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding |CITS:[16376935]|. The C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain belongs to the DeoR-C family of the ISOCOT superfamily and is structurally related to <i>E. coli</i> D-ribose-5-P isomerase |CITS:[16376935]|. Asp206 and Lys209 are directly involved in binding L-ascorbate-6-P |CITS:[18844374]|.

COMMENT - OxyR, "oxidative stress regulator," is the transcriptional dual regulator for the expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress, in particular, elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide. The OxyR regulon includes genes involved in peroxide metabolism, redox balance, and peroxide protection by, for example, manganese uptake |CITS:[2256675][11443091][12100544][19400769]|. Moreover, OxyR activates the synthesis of the small, noncoding <i>oxyS</i> RNA. This allows OxyR to regulate as many as 40 additional gene products indirectly by affecting mRNA stability or translation efficiency |CITS:[9230301]|. OxyR acts as a repressor for its own synthesis in both the oxidized and reduced forms |CITS:[2471187][1864839]|. In addition, expression of <i>oxyR</i> is positively regulated by cAMP-activated Crp protein during exponential growth and negatively regulated by RpoS when cells enter stationary phase |CITS:[9324269]|.
/
/OxyR consists of 305 amino acid residues and is a member of the LysR family of bacterial transcription factors |CITS:[2471187][2511419]|. It is a tetramer in solution |CITS:[7868603]|. OxyR consists of two domains, the N-terminal domain, carrying a helix-turn-helix motif, and the C-terminal regulatory domain. A flexible linker connects both domains. The C-terminal domain contains the determinants for oligomerization and two redox-active cysteines, Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS:[7868603][15543158][12595552]|. OxyR functions as a reversible cellular redox switch. In the presence of 100 nM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, activation occurs by the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208 |CITS:[2183352][15543158]|. Inactivation involves reduction of the disulfide bond by glutaredoxin 1 and glutathione |CITS:[9497290]|. Oxidation is significantly faster than reduction, allowing for transient activation in a reducing environment |CITS:[10339558]|. OxyR is also activated under nitrosative stress; this reaction involves S-nitrosylation of OxyR |CITS:[8797819]|. The crystal structures of the regulatory domain of OxyR in both its reduced and oxidized forms have been solved. Comparison of both structures reveals that oxidation is accompanied by a significant structural change in the regulatory domain |CITS:[11301006]|.
/
/OxyR recognizes a motif comprised of ATAGnt elements spaced at 10-bp intervals |CITS:[8087856]|. The binding to DNA differs significantly for the oxidized and reduced forms |CITS:[8087856]|. Reduced OxyR binds DNA at two pairs of major grooves separated by one helical turn, while oxidized OxyR occupies four consecutive major grooves. When bound to DNA, oxidized OxyR stimulates transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase |CITS:[7592462]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor Ada, for "<b>Ada</b>ptive response to alkylation damage," is positively autoregulated |CITS:[7937881][3139888]| and controls the transcription of the genes involved in the process of reparation of alkylated DNA |CITS:[7937881][7713936][8002588][3529081][10049384][7556074][7937881]|, also called the adaptive response |CITS:[2843522][17823664][11073893]|. O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine and O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine are the major mutagenic lesions resulting from exposure of DNA to simple alkylating agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and, to a lesser degree, methane methanesulfonate (MMS) |CITS:[2843522][3529081][7937881][17823664]|. The O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine and O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine alkylation products constitute potentially mutagenic lesions due to their tendency to mispair with thymine and with guanine, respectively, forming transition mutations. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> there are two separate direct repair mechanisms for the reversal of these types of alkylating lesions through the involvement of two methyltransferases, Ada and Ogt |CITS:[17823664]|.
/
/This regulator contains two functional domains: an N-terminal domain, which contains a motif for DNA binding, and the C-terminal domain, which is involved in the interaction with the RNA polymerase |CITS:[11073893][3887409][6092060][1924363][3141384][8468304][9582376]|. This regulator removes methyl groups (as well as larger groups) from the guanine and thymine substrates and transfers them to its own cysteine residue (Cys-321) in the C-terminal domain. The Ada protein also transfers methyl groups to a second cysteine residue (Cys-69) in the N-terminal domain, from alkylphosphotriesters in DNA  |CITS:[6765195][11073893][8720133][3058696][17823664][3047400]|. This reaction converts the Ada protein into a strong transcriptional activator of several genes. 
/This regulator acts as an activator by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements that overlap the  upstream elements (UP) of the promoters regulated |CITS:[7713936][11073893][8468304][2648001]|.
/
/A model of the mechanism of action of Ada has been proposed  |CITS:[11073893][9582376]|.
/The solution structure of the methylated N-terminal domain of Ada has been determined by NMR and mass spectrometry |CITS:[16452614]|.
/
/We have modified the reported length of the binding site of this protein to 13 bp, according to the proposal by Teo <i>et al</i> |CITS: [3009022]|. Other authors have proposed different lengths and consensus sequences for Ada |CITS: [2648001][7713936]|, but Nakamura <i>et al</i> showed that deletions in this consensus sequence (AAANNAAAGCGCA) decrease the activity of &beta;-galactosidase |CITS: [3139888]|.

COMMENT - "<b>Bet</b>aine <b>i</b>nhibitor," BetI, acts as a repressor of glycine betaine synthesis from choline  |CITS:[8626294]|. It is negatively autoregulated and coordinately represses transcription of the choline transporter and the operon related to the synthesis of glycine betaine. These divergent operons are expressed only under aerobic conditions and are induced by osmotic stress |CITS:[1956285]|.
/
/BetI is an unusual repressor because it remains bound to DNA during induction. BetI forms a complex with DNA in the presence of choline, binding to a 20-bp-long sequence with dyad symmetry that overlaps <i>betT</i>p and <i>betI</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[8626295]|. The position of the repressor gene within the operon is unusual too, as regulatory genes tend to be positioned at the end of operons and this gene is located at the beginning of the operon.
/
/BetI belongs to the TetR/AcrR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[8626295][1956285]|. This protein composed of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal domain involved in co-inducer recognition and dimerization |CITS: [1956285]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>Gal</b>actose i<b>s</b>orepressor," GalS, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of the operons involved in transport and catabolism of D-galactose |CITS: [17630975][7934815][8416900][1619663][8982002]|. Synthesis of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the presence of the inducer (D-galactose) and  the absence glucose |CITS:[8982002][7934815][1619663][8416900]|. GalS is negatively autoregulated, and its expression is increased in the presence of inducer and glucose |CITS:[8416900][8982002]|. 
/
/On the other hand, GalS is highly homologous in its amino acid sequence to GalR (55% identical and 88% similar); apparently both act together and are capable of cross-talking to regulate expression of the <i>gal</i> regulon |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. For this reason these regulators bind the same operators, in the <i>cis</i> regulatory regions, with different affinities. 
/
/In the presence of an inductor, GalS undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. Golding et al. showed that GalR is the major repressor of the <i>gal</i> operon |CITS:[1655705]|. This repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that are 16 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs; each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[7934815][8416900]|. 
/
/GalS belongs to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators. Accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and dimerization |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. GalS and GalR have only two substitutions in the first helix of the N-terminal domain |CITS:[1619663]|.

COMMENT - The NagC, "<b><i>N</i></b>-<b>a</b>cetyl<b>g</b>lu<b>c</b>osamine," transcriptional dual regulator participates in regulating the phosphotransferase system (PTS) |CITS:[18067539]|. Its function is to coordinate the biosynthesis of the amino sugars, D-glucosamine (GlcN) and <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) with their catabolism |CITS: [1766379][11361067][11139621][15066032]|.
/
/The specific inducer for NagC is GlcNAc-6-P, the product of GlcNAc transport by the PTS |CITS:[1766379][11361067]|. NagC is displaced from its DNA targets by interacting with GlcNAc-6-P |CITS:[1766379]|.
/
/Based on the structure of |FRAME: PD01896|, models for the three-dimensional structure of NagC and for the binding of GlcNAc-6-P were developed |CITS:[18067539]|.
/
/The Nag regulon consists of two divergent operons, <i>nagE</i> and <i>nagBACD</i>. <i>nagC</i> encodes the repressor of this regulon. Its localization within the inducible <i>nagBACD</i> operon is unusual, since most transcriptional dual regulators are located near the loci they control |CITS:[1766379]|.
/
/NagC is present at low levels within the bacterial cell |CITS:[1766379]|.
/
/The consensus sequence for the NagC-binding site has been determined via combination of native site comparisons, operator mutagenesis, and selection of DNA-binding fragments, |CITS:[11139621]|. The dual function of NagC requires it to bind simultaneously to two operators in order to form a DNA loop |CITS:[11361067]|. The strictly conserved TT/AA motif, located in both ends of the center of symmetry, is probably the major recognition point for NagC |CITS:[11139621]|.
/
/NagC is a member of the ROK (<b>r</b>epressor, <b>O</b>RFs, <b>k</b>inases) (NagC/XylR) family of proteins, which contains at least two distinct classes of proteins, xylose repressor (XylR) and a series of glucose/fructose kinases |CITS:[7952186][12374829 ]|. 
/
/NagC is similar to Mlc transcriptional dual regulator |CITS:[15916829]|. However, they have different specificities for select binding sites |CITS: [11139621]|.
/
/NagC has a helix-turn-helix motif in its N-terminal part |CITS: [18067539]|.

COMMENT - During anaerobiosis, TdcA participates in controlling genes (<i>tdc</i> operon) involved in transport and metabolism of threonine and serine |CITS:[8413189][11251844][7928991]|.
/
/TdcA belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators, and like the other members of this family, it has a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain for DNA binding |CITS:[8413189]|.  
/
/Although interaction between TdcA and the regulatory region of the <i>tdc</i> operon has not been demonstrated, it has been suggested that TdcA recognizes and binds to an inverted repeat located upstream of the operon |CITS:[7928991]|.
/
/<i>tdcA</i> is the first gene in the <i>tdcABCDEFG</i> operon, which is autoactivated by TdcA. This operon is divergently transcribed with the <i>tdcR</i> gene, whose product also activates the transcription of the operon |CITS:[2573820]|. TdcA probably interacts with TdcR to activate transcription |CITS:[7928991]|, and they appear to function together with CRP and IHF, proteins that  bend the DNA, for this activation |CITS:[11251844]|.
/
/A mutation in the <i>tdcA</i> gene of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes the expression of OmpA protein which is involved, among several other processes, in cellular adherence |CITS:[12933841]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>g</b>l<b>u</b>ci<b>t</b>ol <b>r</b>epressor," GutR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses an operon (<i>gut</i>) involved in transport and utilization of glucitol |CITS:[3062173][3036766]|. This regulator is located in the unusual <i>gut</i> operon, which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors, GutR and GutM, that regulate this operon negatively and positively, respectively; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease |CITS:[3062173]|.
/
/Expression of <i>gutR</i> is activated in the presence of glucitol and in the absence of glucose. Although DNA binding by GutM does not depend on the presence of glucitol, this compound appears to be necessary for derepressing <i>gutM</i>, perhaps by interacting with GutR |CITS:[3062173]|. 
/
/In addition, Yamada et al. suggested that these regulators have contrary effects, but in the presence of glucitol, GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA, causing increments of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of the <i>gut</i> operon |CITS:[3062173]|. To repress transcription, GutR recognizes DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein represses genes involved in glucitol transport and utilization, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS:[3062173]|.
/This regulator belongs to the DeoR family of repressors. GutR is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding |CITS:[3062173]|.

COMMENT - H-NS protein for "<b>H</b>istone-like <b>n</b>ucleoid <b>s</b>tructuring protein," is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein that is capable of condensing |CITS:[10982869]| and supercoiling DNA |CITS:[16384714][15853876][11282470][8306968]|. This protein acts as a pleiotropic transcriptional factor with a strong preference for horizontally acquired genes among the 250 loci to which it binds |CITS:[2126011][17046956]|. H-NS functions almost exclusively as a transcriptional repressor, although there is no clear evidence that this regulator is an activator. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature, although Reush et al. proposed that this regulator can form a complex with a short chain of polyhydroxybutyrate |CITS:[12220682]|. New genes may be identified by high-throughput analysis |CITS:[19151137]|,
/
/H-NS plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress; therefore, it is  capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS:[7934818][8830277]|. It also regulates transcription of many other genes that  participate in a variety of cellular functions, including genes involved in the following processes or responses: biogenesis of flagella |CITS:[8071234][10601207][11872702]|, transcription control of the type I fimbria structural genes |CITS:[9922259][9352908][9595659][7510658][9749677]|, acid resistance  |CITS:[16204188]|, the functional glutamic acid-dependent system |CITS:[10383761]|, osmotically inducible genes |CITS:[9663683]|, the glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system |CITS:[15795232][12446650][11976288][11298273]|, osmotic control |CITS:[8120010][11673423]|, the type II secretion pathway |CITS:[11118204]|, carbon sources |CITS:[2160266]|, genes involved in the RNA component of the small subunit (30S subunit) |CITS:[9632265][15686546]|,  and proteases |CITS:[16143461]|, among others.
/
/H-NS is capable of inducing severe bends in the DNA, interacting with a large number of DNA regions that contain a planar curvature |CITS:[2126011][1745240][14627810]|. It has been suggested that H-NS binds strongly to sites carrying a 10-bp AT-rich consensus sequence, which functions as a nucleation site for the formation of a repressive higher-order nucleoprotein complex |CITS:[17881364][19740756]|. H-NS binds to intergenic regions as well as regions within genes, but not all genes that bind H-NS are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to HN-S in maintenance of nucleoid structure. Currently, there are different models for the formation of DNA-H-NS-DNA bridges which show that this protein binds in tandem to sequences in the genome, forming multimers |CITS:[15853876][17191074][16879983]|.
/
/As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, the expression of <i>hns</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, <i>hns</i> is autoregulated, and it is controlled by different transcription factors. <i>hns</i> is induced by high hydrostatic pressure |CITS: [8226663]| and DNA synthesis |CITS:[8596450]|. At the posttranscriptional level, it is subject to regulation by the sRNAs Hfq and DsrA |CITS:[11115103][12554874][15814430][15147838][12753181]|.
/
/It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to StpA |CITS:[7961433][1480493]| and these two proteins can have similar functions |CITS:[10515926][10947847]|. It has an approximately fivefold-lower affinity for DNA than StpA and has a major preference for curved DNA |CITS:[11278075]|.  
/
/Expression of <i>stpA</i> from a plasmid can complement an <i>hns</i> mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but the specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS:[7961433][11278075][8890170][8635467][19151137][8890170]|. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also, there is evidence that these proteins can form homodimers |CITS:[11244076][8755860][10203842][8755860]|. For this reason, in the absence of H-NS the StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner |CITS:[11244076][10485902]|; protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS |CITS:[11244076]|. On the other hand H-NS also may form heterotrimeric complexes with Hha and YdgT |CITS:[17116239][15458420]|.
/
/H-NS is a small protein and it is an abundant nucleic acid protein in the genome, with about 20,000 copies per cell. This regulator belongs to the histone-like family of transcriptional regulators and the structure of the protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker |CITS:[15100692]|. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it  is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding |CITS:[15100692][10203842][8755860][15063845][19740756]|.

COMMENT - "<b>G</b>lycine <b>c</b>lea<b>v</b>age <b>A</b>," GcvA, is a repressor of the glycine cleavage enzyme system, which is a secondary pathway for production of C<sub>1</sub> units |CITS:[8188587]|. It is negatively autoregulated, and it coordinately activates transcription of a small-RNA divergent gene |CITS:[7665470][10972807]|.
/
/In the absence of glycine and the presence of GcvR, GcvA represses operons involved in the glycine cleavage system |CITS:[7665470][10972807] [11495998]|. GcvR is an accessory protein that binds directly to GcvA, bending DNA to form a repression complex (GcvA/GcvR) in the regulatory region of the <i>gcvT</i> operon |CITS:[11495998]|. 
/
/Glycine binds directly to GcvR to disrupt or block the association of the GcvA/GcvR complex, whereas purines appear to promote the formation of the repression complex through an unknown mechanism |CITS:[12101307][11495998]|. GcvA also activates transcription of the <i>gcv</i> genes, via interaction with the &alpha; or &sigma; subunits of RNA polymerase |CITS:[15621456]|.
/
/This transcriptional dual regulator, which belongs to the LysR-family |CITS:[8188587]|, has two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which appears to be involved in transcription activation and in DNA binding through its helix-turn-helix subdomain, and the carboxy-terminal domain, involved in GcvR interaction |CITS:[9733689][11495998]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>g</b>l<b>u</b>ci<b>t</b>ol regulator," GutM, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates an operon (<i>gut</i>) involved in transport and utilization of glucitol |CITS: [3062173][3036766]|. This regulator is located in the unusual <i>gut</i> operon, which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors, GutR and GutM, that regulate this operon negatively and positively, respectively; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease |CITS:[3062173]|. 
/
/Expression of <i>gutM</i> is increased in the presence of glucitol and in the absence of glucose. Although GutM binding does not depend on the presence of glucitol, this compound appears to be necessary for derepressing <i>gutM</i>, perhaps by interacting with GutR |CITS:[3062173]|. To activate transcription, GutM recognizes DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein activates genes involved in glucitol transport and utilization, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS:[3062173]|. In addition, Yamada et al. suggested that the regulators GutM and GutR have contrary effects; in the absence of glucitol, GutR represses transcription of the <i>gut</i> operon, and in the presence of glucitol, GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA, causing increases of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of the <i>gut</i> operon |CITS:[3062173]|.

CITATIONS - [1346534]
CITATIONS - [7665463]
COMMENT - Lrp, "<b>L</b>eucine-responsive <b>r</b>egulatory <b>p</b>rotein," is a dual transcriptional regulator for at least 10% of the genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[12374860]|. These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions, including 1-carbon metabolism |CITS:[1346534][12675791][7968922]|. In addition, Lrp affects nearly three-fourths of the genes induced upon entry into stationary phase |CITS:[12374860][19052235]|. Lrp might also play a topological role in dynamic DNA packaging |CITS:[8212136]|.
/
/Lrp can act as a repressor or activator for its target genes. Binding of leucine can affect these activities in three different ways: leucine either potentiates, antagonizes, or has no discernible effect upon Lrp action |CITS:[1532173][8432705][8561478]|. It is believed that Lrp senses the presence of rich nutrition based on the concentration of leucine and positively regulates genes that function during famine and negatively regulates genes that function during a feast |CITS:[7968922]|.
/
/Lrp forms a mixture of octamers and hexadecamers |CITS:[11575919]|. In the presence of leucine the octamer configuration is favored. It is believed that the switch between the octameric and hexadecameric states modulated by leucine affects the binding and the activity of Lrp at its target genes |CITS:[12054800]|. The structure of Lrp from <i>Escherichia coli</i> bound to DNA as an octamer has been solved |CITS:[17223133]|. Lrp forms an open ring structure, in which the DNA is wrapped around the octamer in a nucleosome-like structure. The monomer chain contains two domains, an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal &alpha;&beta;-sandwich fold. 
/
/Lrp-regulated promoters commonly contain multiple adjacent binding sites for the protein with low sequence specificity. A consensus recognition sequence has been described |CITS:[8636076]|. The identified 15-bp sequence motif is structured with flanking CAG/CTG triplets and a central AT-rich signal. Leucine has two effects upon binding to DNA <i>in vitro</i>: the affinity of Lrp is reduced but the cooperativity of binding to multiple sites is increased |CITS:[15571719]|.
/
/Lrp belongs to the Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which is widely distributed throughout the eubacterial and archaeal domains. Lrp appears to be very well conserved in members of the &gamma;-proteobacteria |CITS:[12675791]|.
/
/A microarray analysis for Lrp of <i>Escherichia coli</i> was done by |CITS: [12130640]|.

They activate a common set of  genes,  but the expression and activity of each one of these proteins are induced by different signals: the activity of  Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS: [11844771] [12791142]|, and  the transcription of MarA and SoxS is increased by the aromatic weak acid  salicylate |CITS:[11985714]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[ 8955629]|, respectively.
/
/Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated only by one of them.  The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[ 14594836]|.
/
/These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site, a degenerate 19-bp sequence known as the sox-mar-rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance  relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|.  In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in a backwards direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|. In a subset of the class I promoters the sox-mar-rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485] [10564484]|.
/
/For MarA it was shown that the extent of activation at different promoters is only poorly correlated with the strength of MarA binding to the specific mar box |CITS:[18514222]|. By using a computational model of transcriptional activation it was proposed that at the class I promoter of <i>mar</i> MarA increases the binding of RNA polymerase but not the occupancy. At the class II promoters of <i>sodA</i> and <i>micF</i> MarA can even decrease both RNA polymerase affinity and occupancy at the promoter. The model predicts that MarA increases the rate of transcription initiation while decreasing the overall presence of the transcription machinery at the promoter |CITS:[20019803]|.
/
/The sox-mar-rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1,  two recognition elements, the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp  A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS: [10802742][11724537][ 11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. Based on these findings, it was proposed that these proteins activate the transcription by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment," which consists of the formation of the complex  RNA polymerase transcriptional regulator in the absence of DNA, and then this complex scans the DNA to bind to appropriate sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|.
/
/These three proteins belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[ 9409145]|,  and as with other members of this family they have two helix-turn-helix  (HTH) motifs for DNA binding, one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 |CITS:[12217688][ 9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contact with DNA; this was observed for the micF promoter |CITS:[10802742]|.
/
/<i>marA</i> is the second gene of the <i>marRAB</i> operon, which encodes an autorepressor (MarR) and an autoactivator (MarA) |CITS:[ 8383113]|.  MarR is inactivated by salicylate, and then the operon is induced. Upon removal of the inducer (salicylate), MarA is degraded  by the Lon protease |CITS:[15009903]|,  and the binding of MarA with DNA or RNA polymerase protects it from degradation  |CITS:[16556231]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional activator MtlR, for "<b>M</b>anni<b>t</b>o<b>l</b> <b>R</b>rgulator,"  is capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS:[8300537]| and it controls the transcription of the operon involved in mannitol utilization |CITS:[8300537]|. MtlR in the presence of just mannitol produces derepression of the <i>mtlADR</i> operon, but when glucose is present in the medium, this operon is a target of catabolite repression (through CRP), independent of MtlR  |CITS:[8300537]|. MtlA takes up exogenous mannitol, releasing the phosphate ester, mannitol-1-P, into the cell cytoplasm, but it is not clear which of the two metabolites is the inducer of MtlR |CITS: [8300537]|.
/
/To repress transcription, MtlR recognizes DNA-binding sites that overlap the initiation site for transcription of the <i>mtlADR</i> operon, preventing RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[8300537]|, but no consensus sequence has been identified. Figger et al. proposed that an inverted repeat sequence of 24 bp is the possible MtlR-binding site |CITS: [8300537]|. 
/
/MtlR belongs to the Pfam 05068 family, a new class of transcription factors in bacteria that may regulate gene expression indirectly as part of a larger transcriptional complex |CITS:[19840941][14681378]|.
/
/The crystal structures of MtlR from <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and its homolog, the YggD protein from <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, have been determined |CITS:[19840941]|.

/
/SoxS shares 49% identity with MarA and the N-terminal domain of Rob |CITS:[8383113]|. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes |CITS:[10852879][12067348][14712652][11395452]|, the <i>marA/soxS/rob</i> regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance |CITS:[8636021][15853893][7896685]|, superoxide resistance |CITS:[8626315][1400156][1317841]|, and tolerance to organic solvents |CITS:[9324261][9783171]| and heavy metals |CITS:[7793951]|.

It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment." In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|. It has been shown that SoxS binds to the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of RNA polymerase (&alpha;-CTD), in particular, it interacts with amino acid residues lying in or near the DNA-binding determinant of &alpha;-CTD. Apparently, SoxS functions as a co-sigma factor and redirects RNA polymerase to promoters carrying a SoxS-binding site |CITS:[15465042]|. 
/
/A new interaction that also occurs via prerecruitment between &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4 of RNA
/polymerase (RNAP) and SoxS has been identified |CITS: [20595001]|. There is evidence for the
/existence of two types of interactions between SoxS and &sigma;<sup>70</sup> R4, with one type being able to occur "off-DNA" (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex that scans the chromosome for SoxS-dependent promoters) and with the other one occurring "on-DNA" (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex residing at a SoxS-dependent promoter) |CITS: [20595001]|. SoxS is now the first example of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> transcriptional activator that uses a single positive control surface to make specific protein-protein contacts with two different subunits of RNAP |CITS: [20595001]|.

COMMENT - TyrR, "<b>tyr</b>osine <b>r</b>epressor," is the dual transcriptional regulator of the TyrR regulon |CITS:[4887504][4399341][15612913]|. The TyrR regulon involves genes that are essential for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and transport. TyrR can act both as a repressor and as an activator of transcription at &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters |CITS:[1943694]|.
/
/TyrR is a homodimer in solution. In the presence of tyrosine and ATP it self-associates to form a hexamer |CITS:[8176727][11923293]|. TyrR consists of three functional domains, an N-terminal domain (aa 1-190), a central domain (aa 206-433), and a C-terminal domain (aa 444-513). The structure of the N-terminal domain has been solved |CITS:[17222426]|. It contains both an ACT and a PAS domain and is responsible for the activation functions of TyrR. The central domain carries an AAA+ domain typical for enhancer-binding proteins |CITS:[12018490]|. This domain is responsible for the binding and hydrolysis of ATP and for the ATP-dependent binding of the aromatic amino acid cofactors. In addition it possesses a phosphatase activity that is stimulated by zinc ions and inhibited by L-tyrosine and ATP |CITS:[10648532]|. The central domain is responsible for the repressor functions of TyrR and contains determinants important for the hexamerization |CITS:[11923293]|. The C-terminal domain carries a classic HTH motif and is involved in DNA binding and dimerization |CITS:[8449883][11344327]|.
/
/TyrR binds specifically to an 18-bp palindromic target sequence, the Tyr box |CITS:[3525516][ 1943694]|. TyrR binds to strong boxes in the absence of any cofactors. Binding to weak boxes requires ATP, tyrosine, or in the case of <i>tyrB</i> tyrosine or phenylalanine, and an adjacent strong box |CITS:[1943694][12207706]|. TyrR can act as a transcriptional activator and repressor. Repression requires ATP-dependent binding of aromatic amino acids to the central domain with one exception: TyrR represses its own transcription without additional cofactors. Tyrosine is the major effector of TyrR-mediated repression. Some repression occurs with phenylalanine as a cofactor in the case of <i>aroF</i> |CITS:[4399341]|, <i>aroL</i> |CITS:[7961453]|, <i>tyrP</i> and <i>aroP</i> |CITS:[334742]|, and <i>aroG</i> |CITS:[2861143]| or with tryptophan as a cofactor for <i>aroL</i> |CITS:[7961453]| and <i>aroP</i> |CITS:[334742]|. Activation appears to involve non ATP-dependent binding of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan to the N-terminal domain of TyrR and the binding of TyrR to a strong box located upstream of the ?35 region of the promoter. TyrR activates transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the &alpha;-subunit of polymerase |CITS:[7798138]|.

COMMON-NAME - CadC DNA-binding transcriptional activator
CITATIONS - 92105022:EV-EXP-IMP:3363693452:shearer
COMMENT - CadC is a metal-sensitive transcriptional activator that regulates the expression of genes involved in cadaverine synthesis and excretion under low external pH and high concentrations of lysine |CITS:[1370290][8195083][16491024]|.
/
/Two binding sites for CadC, Cad1 and Cad2, have been determined in the <i>cadBA</i> operon. While Cad1 contains an inverted repeat sequence, Cad2 lacks either an inverted repeat or a palindromic sequence. Both binding sites are necessary for <i>cadBA</i> activation. Under aerobic conditions, H-NS represses the <i>cadBA</i> operon. Upon binding to Cad1, CadC releases the bound H-NS molecules, dissolving the H-NS repressor complex and allowing RNA polymerase binding. Transcription of <i>cadBA</i> is finally activated once a molecule of CadC binds to Cad2 |CITS:[16491024]|.
/
/CadC is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the ToxR-like family of transcriptional activators. It features a cytoplasmic DNA-binding N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a periplasmic C-terminal domain |CITS:[16491024]|.
/
/In the absence of lysine, LysP regulates CadC negatively |CITS:[8195083]|.

COMMENT - LeuO is a dual transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in leucine biosynthesis |CITS: [15582999][6987127]|, genes involved in the utilization of certain &beta;-glucosides |CITS:[9422614][16207917]|, and genes encoding LuxR-type transcription factors |CITS:[18055596]|. It is also involved in the bacterial stringent response |CITS: [11376008]|.
/
/LeuO is one of the transcription factors that counteract H-NS-mediated repression of specific loci |CITS:[15582999][16207917][9422614]|. Overproduction of LeuO causes the phenotype Bgl<sup>+</sup>, since LeuO can unsilence the <i>bglGFB</i> operon, which is silenced (phenotypically Bgl<sup> </sup>) under laboratory conditions |CITS:[9422614]|.
/
/LeuO is part of the RpoS/H-NS/Hfq/LeuO/DsrA RNA regulatory cascade that controls the <i>bglGFH</i> operon |CITS:[16207917]| and translation of <i>rpoS</i>, particularly at low temperatures |CITS: [9302018][14594834]|.
/
/LeuO belongs to the LysR transcriptional regulator family and contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain |CITS:[9422614][3413113]|. No LeuO consensus binding sequence is known |CITS: [18055596]|.
/
/LeuO activates transcription of the divergent <i>leuLABCD</i> operon |CITS: [11121424]|.
/
/An <i>in vivo</i> genetic selection (SELEX) and phenotype microarray analysis revealed several multidrug resistance genes as targets for LeuO, including <i>acrEF</i>, <i>ygcLKJIH-ygbTF</i>, and <i>mdtNOP</i> (<i>sdsRQP</i>). <i>mdtNOP</i> (<i>sdsRQP</i>) is involved in sensitivity control against sulfa drugs |CITS:[19429622]|.

COMMENT - The <b>Lac</b>tose <b>i</b>nhibitor," LacI, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of the operon involved in transport and catabolism of lactose |CITS:[2166165][8568874][15950160]|. In the absence of allolactose, LacI represses the <i>lac</i> operon |CITS:[2166165]|. In this repression system, LacI binds to two operators, and formation of the repressor loop is critical |CITS:[8984648][8984647][14725772][2166165]|. This repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that are 21 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs |CITS:[2166165][8984648][8984647]|. 
/
/Induction occurs when the physiological inducer, allolactose, binds to the <i>lac</i> repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator |CITS:[2166165][15950160]|. Nonphysiological analogs, such as thiogalactosides, can function as inducers too. 
/
/The LacI protein belongs to the GalR/LacI family and as a member of this family of transcriptional regulators, LacI contains three domains: a helix-turn-helix motif located in the N terminus, the central domain that binds to LacI sugar ligands, and the C terminal, which comprises the tetramerization domain|CITS:[15950160]|.

COMMENT - The AppY, "<b>a</b>cid <b>p</b>hos<b>p</b>hatase," transcriptional regulator induces the expression of energy metabolism genes under anaerobiosis, stationary phase, and phosphate starvation. Under these same conditions, the expression of the <i>appY</i> gene is induced |CITS:[8626281][9079897]|. The genes regulated by AppY have promoters that are recognized by both &sigma;<sup>70</sup> and &sigma;<sup>38</sup>; AppY activates their transcription when any of these &sigma; factors is bound to the RNA polymerase |CITS:[9079897]|. The specific AppY binding site has not yet been identified.
/
/When AppY is overproduced, the expression of 30 proteins is induced or repressed in a growth phase-dependent fashion. Overproduction of AppY also causes an elevated spontaneous mutation rate. Therefore, it is possible that this protein regulates genes involved in DNA replication, recombination, or repair |CITS:[15225322]|.
/
/AppY, which belongs to the AraC/XylS family, has a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that shows a helix-turn-helix motif |CITS:[2537825][8451183]|. The proteins with greatest similarity to AppY are CfaD of enterotoxigenic <i> Escherichia coli</i> and VirF of <i>Shigella flexneri</i> |CITS: [8451183]|.

COMMENT - EnvY  is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that participates in the control of several genes that encode cellular envelope proteins at low temperatures and during stationary phase |CITS:[ 6317653]|.
/
/This protein is an envelope protein |CITS:[ 6317653]| that contains a putative membrane-spanning region, and as for the members of the family of transcriptional regulators (AraC/XylS) that it pertains to |CITS:[ 8451183]|, it also contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding in the C-terminal region |CITS:[8451183][ 7503752]|. 
/
/The transcriptional regulators of <i>E. coli</i > that show higher similarity to EnvR are AppY and AdiY |CITS:[ 7503752]|. The latter, like EnvY, also has a putative transmembrane region |CITS:[ 7503752]|.
/
/No research has been done to determine the DNA-binding sites for EnvY.

COMMENT - The transcriptional repressor DeoR, for "<b>Deo</b>xyribose <b>R</b>egulator," is involved in the negative expression of genes related to transport and catabolism of deoxyribonucleoside nucleotides |CITS:[171553][6098525][2998936][3019678][2826388][3019678][2265760][2667765][1791752][2115441]|. 
/
/DeoR belongs to the DeoR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[2994018][8955387]|.

COMMENT - RutR regulates genes directly or indirectly involved in the complex pathway of pyrimidine metabolism |CITS:[ 16540542][17919280]| and also plays a role in regulation of the genes for degradation of purines and genes for maintenance of pH homeostasis |CITS:[17919280]|.
/
/This protein belongs to the TetR family, whose members have an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal domain for dimerization and ligand binding |CITS:[15944459]|.
/
/RutR recognizes and binds a 16-bp (7-2-7) inverted repeat consensus sequence |CITS:[17919280][18515344]|, where the central A/T nucleotide in each half-site appears to be the most important for the site |CITS:[18515344]|. This binding is inhibited when uracil and thymine bind to RutR, although the effect is greater for uracil than for thymine |CITS:[17919280]|.
/
/It has been demonstrated, in <i>E. coli</i> as in other bacteria,  that RutR binds to several coding regions located hundreds of base pairs downstream of the start codon. However, no role in transcriptional regulation of this binding has been observed |CITS: [18515344]|.
/

COMMON-NAME - CsgD DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3278863360:pkarp
COMMENT - The protein CsgD, for "<b>C</b>urlin <b>s</b>ubunit <b>g</b>ene <b>D</b>," is a transcriptional regulator |CITS:[8817489]| that regulates a number of genes involved in the Curli assembly, transport, and structural components |CITS:[9383186][8817489]|, which are important for biofilm formation |CITS:[14523117]|. In addition, it also regulates genes related to cell surface-associated structures |CITS:[14523117][18599830][16513732]|. It may also have the capability to respond to starvation and high cell density |CITS:[14523117]| and positively controls &sigma;<sup>S</sup> expression |CITS:[16600914][17873038]|. In general the environmental conditions, such as low osmolarity, low growth temperature (<32&deg;C), and low growth, affect the expression of <i>csgD</i> and the production of the biofilm and cellulose |CITS:[18599830][11717281][8173808]|.
/
/Since <i>csgD</i> is induced during the mid-exponential phase of growth and the CsgD-dependent activation of <i>csg</i> genes is detected in the stationary phase, it has been suggested that CsgD is posttranscriptionally activated in the stationary phase  |CITS:[14523117]|.

/CsgD might activate transcription through two different mechanisms, as suggested by the different locations of its binding sites in the regulatory regions of the genes it activates. In one regulatory region, the protein binds to a single site, whereas it binds to two sites arranged as inverted repeats in another region |CITS:[14523117]|. 
/
/CsgD belongs to the FixJ/LuxR/UhpA family, which is characterized by a C-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a receiver domain in the N-terminal region |CITS:[8218244]|.

COMMENT - FadR <b>F</b>atty <b>a</b>cid <b>d</b>egradation <b>R</b>egulon |CITS:[4887396]|, is a multifunctional dual regulator |CITS:[2843809]| that exerts negative control over the fatty acid degradative regulon |CITS:[6247326][7009562]| and acetate metabolism |CITS:[7026540]|, whereas it is responsible for the maximal expression of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS:[6341354]|. FadR regulates coordinately fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation at the level of transcription |CITS:[8446033]|. In this way, FadR functions as switch between fatty acid &beta;-oxidation and fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS:[11279025]|
/
/FadR belongs to the GntR family |CITS:[11013219][2060763]|. However, Xu et al. (2001) reported that homologies to CAP and the Tet repressor based on structure are more relevant and they have categorized FadR as a chimera of two motifs |CITS:[11279025]|.
/
/FadR appears to be a two-domain dimeric molecule in which the N-terminal domains |CITS: [7836365][9388199] [1569108][2843809]| bind to DNA whereas the C-terminal domain binds the fatty acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) |CITS:[11279025]|. In addition, there is a linker which links both the N terminal and C terminal. The binding of the acyl-CoA disrupts a buried network of charged and polar residues in the C-terminal domain, and the resulting conformational change is transmitted to the N-terminal domain via a domain-spanning &alpha;-helix CoA |CITS:[11279025]|; in this way there is loss of DNA binding |CITS:[10739923]|, since acyl-CoA regulates DNA binding by FadR |CITS:[1569108][9045847]|.
/
/The &alpha;/&beta; N-terminal domain (&alpha;1-&beta;1-&alpha;2-&alpha;3-&beta;2-&beta;3) has a winged-helix motif, and the &alpha;-helical C-terminal domain (&alpha;6-&alpha;7-&alpha;8-&alpha;9-&alpha;10-&alpha;11-&alpha;12) resembles the sensor domain of the Tet repressor |CITS:[11279025]| and PAS domain, in particular the photoactive yellow protein |CITS:[10739923]|, and finally the linker comprising two short &alpha;-helices (&alpha;4-&alpha;5) |CITS:[11279025]|.
/
/The binding of FadR to DNA is determined by the localization of the &alpha;3 recognition helices that are paired together at the dimer interface |CITS:[11279025]|.
/
/The DNA-binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria, whereas the C-terminal acyl-CoA-binding domain shows only weak conservation |CITS:[16027119]|.
/
/A FadR-type regulator has been identified in <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> |CITS:[18835990]|, <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> |CITS:[18039772]|, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>, and <i>Hemophilus influenzae</i> |CITS:[16027119]|.
/
/FadR is a homodimer |CITS:[9388199][11279025]| that recognizes a palindromic sequence, 5'-TGGNNNNNCCA-3' |CITS:[11279025]|.

COMMENT - DgsA, better known as Mlc, "<b>m</b>akes <b>l</b>arge <b>c</b>olonies," |CITS:[7766024]| is a transcriptional dual
/regulator that controls the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the <i>Escherichia coli</i>
/phosphotransferase (PTS) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) systems |CITS:[ 11934616 ][16519088]|. It also regulates genes
/involved in the uptake of glucose |CITS:[11139621]|. It is considered a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism
/|CITS: [9484893][9781886]|. In addition, Mlc regulates expression of the MalT transcriptional regulator, the activator of the
/maltose regulon |CITS: [9484893]|. 
/
/Mlc repressor function is disabled by binding of Mlc to an actively-transported and dephosphorylated form of PtsG
/(EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>) |CITS:[11032803][11157755]|. The membrane-bound part of EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> is essential for
/Mlc inactivation |CITS: [11157755][12529317]|.  Analysis of the crystal structures of the tetrameric Mlc/EIIB complex shows a
/molecular mechanism of Mlc inactivation by membrane sequestration, in which Mlc loss its DNA binding ability <i>in vivo</i>
/due to the conformational obstruction by EIIB molecules |CITS:[18319344]|.
/
/The crystal structure of Mlc has been determined |CITS:[16510988][15929984]| to 2.85 and 2.7 &Aring; resolution and Mlc in
/complex with four molecules of enzyme IIBGlc (EIIB) |CITS: [18319344]| to 2.85 &Aring; resolution. Mlc forms stable dimers
/and binds to palindromic operator sites. The N-terminal region has a helix-turn-helix domain, and a C-terminal helix is implicated in EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> binding |CITS: [12529317]|. Mlc forms tetramers in solution |CITS:[16510988][12529317][11157755]|. The Mlc monomer is composed of three domains: a DNA-binding motif (D-domain), an EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>-binding motif (E-domain), and an oligomerization domain (O-domain) |CITS: [18319344]|.
/
/Mlc is autoregulated |CITS:[9484893][11340070]|, but it is also repressed and activated by CRP |CITS:[11340070]|. Mlc binds to sites with a length of 23 bp. Its consensus sequence has been determined |CITS:[11139621]|.
/
/The intracellular concentration of Mlc is very limited |CITS:[11157755]|. Zinc mediates the Mlc repressor function |CITS:[15929984]|. Mlc has a high homology with the NagC transcriptional dual regulator (40% identity and 80% similarity) |CITS:[7766024][15916829]|. At the post-transcriptional level, Mlc interacts with MtfA, which is involved in the regulation of the <i>ptsG</i> |CITS:[16855233]|.
/
/Mlc is a member of the ROK (<b>r</b>epressor, <b>O</b>RFs, <b>k</b>inases) (NagC/XylR) family of proteins, which contains at least two distinct classes of proteins: xylose repressor (XylR) and a series of glucose/fructose kinases |CITS: [7952186][ 12374829 ]|.

COMMON-NAME - SdiA DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3278863360:pkarp
COMMENT - The transcription factor SdiA, for "<b>S</b>uppressor of the cell <b>d</b>ivision <b>i</b>nhibitor," is possibly positively autoregulated and controls the transcription of the genes involved in cell division |CITS:[8631660][8552633][11555297][1915297][11244066]|. SdiA has been shown to increase transcription from the P2 promoter of the <i>ftsQAZ</i> operon |CITS:[8552633]| by facilitating RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region |CITS:[11555297]|. SdiA activates the expression of <i>ydiV</i>, which is involved in the interaction between two quorum-sensing systems. An <i>sdiA</i> <i>ydiV</i> double mutant reduces cAMP levels, which inhibits quorum-sensing system 2 |CITS:[18560382]|. Expression of <i>sdiA</i>itself is regulated by a mechanism similar to quorum sensing: exposure to conditioned medium results in a 50-80% decrease in <i>sdiA</i> expression |CITS:[8631660]|. 
/
/Overexpression of SdiA speeds up cell division |CITS:[1915297]| and causes apparently concomitant morphological changes; in both exponential and stationary phases, cells appear rounder and shorter |CITS:[11244065]|. Overexpression of SdiA also leads to resistance to the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C as well as to other drugs |CITS:[11244065][11244066]|, while an <i>sdiA</i> null mutant strain was not hypersensitive to mitomycin C |CITS:[11244065]| but was more sensitive to flouroquinolones |CITS:[11929524]|. In addition, SdiA also affects the expression of a number of genes, including a decrease in expression of several motility |CITS:[20126629]| and chemotaxis |CITS:[11244066]| genes,  a pleiotropic effect over the expression of genes involved in cell division, drug sensitivity, DNA replication and repair, macromolecular metabolism |CITS:[11244066]|, genes involved in the glutamate-dependent acid resistance systems (AR-2) |CITS:[20126629]|, and an increase in the expression of the AcrAB multidrug efflux pump proteins |CITS:[11929524]|.  
/
/On the other hand, SdiA is highly homologous to quorum-sensing transcription factors that belong to the LuxR family |CITS:[11544237][15130116][11115115][16307757]|. The molecule inducer is represented by different N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are signaling molecules involved in communication between bacteria (quorum-sensing systems) |CITS:[15130116][16487323][19168658][11292813][15995228][16487745][8631660][20126629]|. Lee et al. showed that the transcription that SdiA mediates is controlled by indole, but whether the effect is indirect or direct is not known |CITS:[17511876][18528414]|. On the other hand Dyszel et al. showed that the SdiA protein is partially dependent upon a diffusible molecule [N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] |CITS:[17511876][18528414][20126629]|.
/
/Accordingly, this family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved C-terminal  domain which contains the DNA-binding region |CITS:[11115115]| and the N-terminal domain, which is  involved in effector binding  |CITS:[16307757]|.

Synthesis of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the presence of inducer (D-galactose) and the absence glucose |CITS:[8982002][7934815][1619663][8416900]|. The expression of <i>galR</i> is increased only in the presence of inducer |CITS:[8416900][8982002]|. 
/
/In particular, in the absence of D-galactose, GalR represses the <i>galETKM</i> operon |CITS:[9218807]|. In this repression system, GalR binds to two operators in the presence of HU, resulting in the formation of a repressor loop |CITS:[9218807][12169637][15289461]|. This repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that are 16 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs; each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[7934815][8416900]|. 
/
/On the other hand, GalR is highly homologous in its amino acid sequence to GalS (55% identical and 88% similar); apparently both act together and are capable of cross-talk to regulate expression of the <i>gal</i> regulon |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. For this reason these regulators bind the same operators, in the <i>cis</i> regulatory regions, with different affinities |CITS:[8175668]|. In the presence of inductor, GalR undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. Golding et al. showed that GalR is the major repressor of the <i>gal</i> operon |CITS:[1655705]|.
/
/GalR belongs to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators. Accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and dimerization |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. GalR and GalS have only two substitutions in the first helix of the N-terminal domain |CITS:[1619663]|.

COMMENT - EbgR (for "evolved &beta;-galactosidase repressor") negatively regulates
/genes involved in the evolved &beta;-galactosidase system, which
/constitutes an alternative for lactose utilization in cells with mutations
/on the <i>lacZ</i> gene |CITS: [3939708][10234816]|.
/
/The wild-type Ebg enzyme, encoded by the <i>ebg</i> operon, is not

/<i>ebgA</i>, however, enhance its catalytic activity and enable rapid
/growth on lactose as a sole carbon source |CITS: [3939708][10234816]|.
/
/EbgR belongs to the GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators. There
/is strong evidence that the <i>ebg</i> and <i>lac</i> operons share a
/common origin in evolution |CITS: [3939708]|. EbgR diverged from other

COMMENT - The <b>Exu</b>ronate <b>r</b>epressor," ExuR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that negatively regulates its own synthesis and represses transcription of the operons involved in transport and catabolism of galacturonate and glucuronate |CITS:[6808145][11115104][6450743][7007313][7026975][783117]|.
/
/On the other hand, ExuR is similar to UxuR (49% of identity), and apparently both act together and are capable of cross-talk to regulate expression of the <i>uxu</i> operon |CITS: [11115104][7007313][6353163][3929016]|. For this reason, there is the possibility that these regulators bind the same sites with different affinities. 
/
/Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in the literature, and although little is known about the regulating mechanism of ExuR, it has been shown to act as a repressor that binds to a putative inverted repeat sequence |CITS: [11115104]|. Comparative analysis of intergenic DNA sequences showed the consistent occurrence of ExuR possible binding sites upstream of the genes related to the transport of gluconate (<i>gntP</i>) and with the transport and degradation of glucuronides (<i>uidAB</i>) |CITS: [11115104]|.

COMMENT - During anaerobiosis, TdcR participates in controlling several genes involved in transport and metabolism of threonine and serine |CITS:[2573820][11251844][7928991]|.  
/
/TdcR has a helix-turn-helix motif that shows 25% and 35% identity to the same motifs of the transcriptional regulators NtrC and Fis, respectively |CITS:[2573820]|.  
/
/It appears that due to the fact that the <i>tdcR</i> gene shows poor codon usage and a poor Shine-Dalgarno sequence, it is weakly expressed |CITS:[2573820]|. <i>tdcR</i> is transcribed alone and is  located divergently in the genome from the operon (<i>tdcABCD</i>), whose transcription is activated by TdcR. The first gene of the operon codes for TdcA, a transcriptional regulator that probably interacts with TdcR to activate the transcription of the operon |CITS:[7928991]|, and these two proteins appear to function together with CRP and IHF, proteins that bend the DNA, for this activation |CITS:[11251844]|.

COMMENT - The <b>G</b>luco<b>n</b>a<b>t</b>e <b>r</b>epressor," GntR, is a transcription factor that negatively regulates the operon involved in the catabolism of d-gluconate via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and also represses genes involved in two different systems related to d-gluconate uptake: gluconate I and gluconate II |CITS:[11115104][14593252][12618441][9658018]|. This regulator is part of the <i>gntRKU</i> operon, yet it can also be constitutively expressed as an independent (<i>gntR</i>) transcription unit |CITS:[9135111][8655507]|. 
/
/Gluconate I is considered the main system for transport of d-gluconate and contains genes that encode high- and low-affinity gluconate transporters |CITS:[11115104][9045817][9871335][9358057][9537375]|. The d-gluconate II system is capable of transport of l-idonate and also is regulated by IdnR; the genes involved in this system encode another high-affinity gluconate transporter |CITS:[11115104][14593252][12618441][9658018]|. 
/
/In addition, the genes regulated are induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown in the presence of the inductor, d-gloconate, and in the absence of glucose.

COMMENT - The "<b>C</b>old <b>s</b>hock protein A," CspA, is a major cold shock protein and was shown to be detected only during early-log-phase growth at 37&deg;C and during log phase after a shift from 37&deg;C to 10&deg;C |CITS:[3553157][2404279]|. CspA acts as a positive transcription factor of at least two cold shock genes: <i>hns</i> |CITS:[7748932][1961761][11278076]| and <i>gyrA</i> |CITS:[1325964]|. <i>cspA</i> has been shown to negatively regulate its own expression as the result of attenuation of transcription |CITS:[9371456]|. A model of how CspA might affect the transcription of <i>hns</i> has been proposed |CITS:[17088256]|. CspE inhibits the expression of <i>cspA</i> <i>in vitro</i> by increasing pause recognition by RNA polymerase at the <i>cspA</i> "cold box" |CITS:[10200963]|.
/
/CspA belongs to the cold shock family of proteins and was shown to be homologous to eukaryotic Y-box transcription factors |CITS:[9484881][3174636]|. The transcription factors of this family recognize a CCAAT sequence in the regulatory region of the genes regulated |CITS:[11278076][7748932]|.
/
/The crystal structure of CspA has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0 &Aring; |CITS:[8197194]|; also, the structure of CspA has been determined by NMR spectroscopy |CITS:[ 7515185] [9692981]|.  
/
/On other hand, Jiang et al. in 1997 demonstrated that CspA acts as an RNA chaperone that prevents secondary structure formation in RNA at low temperatures |CITS:[8995247][9371456]|. <i>cspA</i> mRNA is very unstable at 37&deg;C and rapidly disappears as cell density and RNase activity increase |CITS:[1597410][10075935]|. The lability of <i>cspA</i> mRNA at high temperatures is mediated by cleavage toward its 3' end; this cleavage is partially dependent on RNase E |CITS:[17416651]|. The long 5' untranslated region of <i>cspA</i> mRNA contains a feature within the first 25 bases that is responsible for derepression of <i>cspA</i> expression and inhibition of synthesis of cellular proteins other than cold shock proteins following cold shock |CITS:[8759856]|. <i>cspA</i> was also shown to be induced by addition of chloramphenicol and was induced even in the absence of protein synthesis |CITS:[8376329][10074075]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor RbsR, for "<b>R</b>i<b>b</b>o<b>s</b>e <b>R</b>epressor," is negatively autoregulated and controls the transcription of the operon involved in ribose catabolism and transport |CITS:[1304369][6327616][11750821]|. Transcription of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, D-ribose, binds to the RbsR repressor |CITS:[11750821][3011793]|. When D-ribose binds to RbsR, the protein becomes inactive because the binding affinity of RbsR decreases |CITS:[1304369]|.
/
/Although little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the RbsR transcription factor, Mauzy et al. in 1992 demonstrated that this regulator acts as a repressor by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements, which have a conserved inverted repeat sequence, that overlap the <i>rbsD</i>p promoter |CITS:[1304369]|.
/
/RbsR belongs to the GalR/LacI family |CITS:[1304369]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor IclR, for "<b>I</b>so<b>c</b>itrate <b>l</b>yase <b>R</b>egulator," is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[8550439]| and it regulates the expression of the glyoxylate bypass operon  |CITS:[18942160][8626344][1995429][2512996][7033207][2001680]|. Transcription of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown during acetate accumulation in the exponential phase. Glyoxylate and pyruvate have been identified as effectors of IclR and show antagonistic effects. While glyoxylate favors the inactive dimeric state of IclR, pyruvate increases the binding of IclR to the aceBp promoter by stabilizing the active tetrameric form of the protein |CITS:[17426033]|.
/
/On other hand, the genes of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon are expressed to varied degrees due to two facts: first, they are differentially regulated at the translational level, and second, there is a putative premature transcriptional termination in the region preceding the <i>aceK</i> gene |CITS:[16415587]|. 
/
/
/IclR represses <i>aceBAK</i> transcription through two mechanisms |CITS:[12492863]|: (1) binding to the proximal site, overlapping the -35 promoter box, and preventing RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[8682810][1447784][2001680]|, and (2) binding to the distal site after the RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter and formed the open complex, avoiding the polymerase escape of the promoter through its interaction with the &alpha;-subunits. Perhaps the IclR binding at both sites forms an intermolecular bridge that leads to a DNA loop structure and thus enhances the <i>aceBAK</i>  repression |CITS:[12492863]|.
/
/This regulator belongs to the IclR family of repressors. IclR is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is responsible for inducer binding |CITS:[1447784][2185227][17426033][8844850][1995431]|.
/
/The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of IclR (2.3&Aring;) has been solved  |CITS:[17426033]|.
/
/An <i>iclR</i> mutation affects the carbon flow in the metabolism |CITS:[15543598][15885621]|.

COMMON-NAME - Rob DNA-binding transcriptional activator
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3278863360:pkarp
CITATIONS - [8449900]
CITATIONS - [7896685]
COMMENT - Rob is a transcriptional dual regulator. Its N-terminal domain shares 49% identity with MarA and SoxS |CITS:[8383113]|. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes |CITS:[10852879][12067348][14712652][11395452]|, the <i>marA/soxS/rob</i> regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance |CITS:[8636021][15853893][7896685]|, superoxide resistance |CITS:[8626315][1400156][1317841]|, and tolerance to organic solvents |CITS:[9324261][9783171]| and heavy metals |CITS:[7793951]|. The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate |CITS:[11844771][12791142]|, and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate |CITS:[11395452]| and oxidative stress |CITS:[8955629]|, respectively. 
/
/Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites |CITS:[14594836]|. 
/
/Rob, MarA, and SoxS bind as monomers to the same DNA site, a degenerate 20-bp sequence known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the  -35 and  -10 boxes of the promoter |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the  -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the  -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the  -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation |CITS:[10564485][10564484]|.
/
/The Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an "invariant A" at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements |CITS:[10802742][11724537][11401718]|. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome |CITS:[11866462]|. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter |CITS:[11985714]|. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named "DNA scanning" or "prerecruitment." In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites |CITS:[11985714][11866462]|. 
/
/Rob consists of two domains and belongs to the AraC/XylS family |CITS:[9409145]|. The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain and is homologous to MarA and SoxS and the C-terminal domain of AraC. It carries two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding. One of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with RE2 |CITS:[12217688][9724717][11724537]|. In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of the two HTH motifs makes base-specific contacts with DNA |CITS:[10802742]|. The crystal structures of Rob |CITS:[10802742]| and MarA |CITS:[9724717]| in complex with DNA and the solution structure of the DNA-binding domain of AraC |CITS:[19422057]| have been solved.
/
/The C-terminal domain of Rob is similar to a portion of the enzyme GalT |CITS:[10802742]|. It regulates the activity of Rob by a "sequestration-disposal" mechanism, that is, it mediates the sequestration of Rob into intracellular foci. Sequestered Rob is inactive. Upon addition of the inducer, Rob is released in its active form |CITS:[19289129]|. The C-terminal domain blocks in addition proteolytic degradation by Lon protease |CITS:[19289129]|.
/
/<i>rob</i> appears to be transcribed abundantly at 5,000-10,000 molecules per cell |CITS:[8449900][10515926]|, throughout the growth cycle. <i>rob</i> expression is enhanced at the stationary phase and under glucose and phosphate starvation, and it was suggested that expression of rob is &sigma;<sup>S</sup> dependent |CITS:[7476863]|.

UNIQUE-ID - PUTA-MONOMER
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - fused PutA transcriptional repressor / proline dehydrogenase / 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase
COMMENT - PutA is a flavoprotein with mutually exclusive functions as a transcriptional repressor and membrane-associated enzyme.  The switch between the two activities is due to conformational changes triggered by proline binding.  In the presence of proline, PutA is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of the |FRAME: PROUT-PWY| pathway: the oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase.  In the absence of proline, PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <i>put</i> regulon.

/The N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain the dimerization domain and the specific DNA-binding activity of PutA |CITS: [15155740][18586269]|.  The Lys9 residue is essential for recognition of <i>put</i> promoter DNA |CITS: [17001030]|.  Crystal structures of this domain have been solved |CITS: [17001030][18586269]|.  In the absence of proline, PutA binds to operator sequences in the <i>putA</i>-<i>putP</i> intergenic region and represses transcription, most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to the <i>putA</i> promoter |CITS: [18586269]|.
/
/The proline dehydrogenase activity resides in the amino-terminal 669 amino acids of PutA; a truncated protein retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity but lacks membrane association and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity |CITS: [12009917]|.  Proline dehydrogenase activity requires the presence of an electron acceptor; <i>in vivo</i>, it is thought that the reduced |FRAME: FADH2| transfers electrons to the quinone pool in the cytoplasmic membrane, and finally to oxygen via the respiratory chain |CITS: [6305659]|.  Association of the enzyme with the membrane is dependent on reduction of the FAD cofactor, which induces a change in the conformation of the protein |CITS: [3540963][8473341][12731889]|.  Both proline binding and FAD reduction contribute to the conformational change |CITS: [16156643]|.  The membrane-associated form of PutA does not bind <i>put</i> promoter DNA; thus, the enzymatic and DNA-binding activities of PutA are mutually exclusive |CITS: [15476410]|.
/
/Crystal structures of the amino-terminal proline dehydrogenase domain have been reported |CITS: [12514740][15449943][17209558][19140736][19994913]|, and site-directed mutants in various active site residues have been characterized |CITS: [15449943][15450175][17209558][19140736]|.  These studies resulted in a detailed picture of the mechanism of the redox-dependent structural changes of the protein and identified Y540 as an important substrate specificity determinant.
/
/The C-terminal domain shows similarity to aldehyde dehydrogenases, indicating that the true substrate for the second enzymatic activity may be &gamma;-glutamic semialdehyde, which is thought to spontaneously equilibrate with P5C |CITS: [7966312]|.
/
/Expression of <i>putA</i> is reduced by prolonged exposure to osmotic stress |CITS: [2684374]|.

COMMENT - RcsB protein for "<b>R</b>egulator <b>c</b>apsule <b>s</b>ynthesis <b>B</b>," is a response regulator that belongs to the multicomponent RcsF/RcsC/RcsD/RcsA-RcsB phosphorelay system |CITS:[11758943][17185552][16153174][16166540][16740933][1943696]| and is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of colanic acid capsule, cell division, periplasmic proteins, motility, and a small RNA |CITS: [16427772][16153174][7855424][8366025][2836365][10702265][8576059][10564486][3888955][1999391][7534408][8763957][12864862][16000739][16776655][19026860]|. 
/
/The response regulator RcsB is the principal regulator of this system and it may form complexes with the RcsA auxiliary protein  (forming a heterodimer) |CITS:[1943696][7855424][10702265][8763957][16153174][17468243][12864862][17379715]|, while RcsB activates the others genes independently (in the form of a homodimer) |CITS:[16153174][11566985][15901715][15838058][10564486][12410838][1597415]|.
/
/RcsC is a sensor histidine kinase and is known to be a transmembrane protein composed of three domains: the external sensory domain (amino terminal), a cytoplasmic transmitter domain (carboxyl terminal), and a transmembrane hydrophobic central domain (unknown function). RcsC is a membrane-bound protein that is able to sense extracellular changes in temperature, overexpression of membrane protein, and osmolarity |CITS:[14514676][16153174][8576059]|. RcsC is a hybrid kinase, contains both an H1 and D1 domain, and is able to transfer phosphoryl groups to the conserved Hpt domain of RcsD |CITS:[16153174][16427772][16153174]|. RcsC and RcsD are inner membrane proteins that are involved in the phosphorylation of RcsB in response to environmental signals |CITS:[16153174][9209051]|. Once phosphorylated, the RcsB protein is a positive regulator  and it increases the affinity for the specific DNA-binding sites and controls the transcriptional expression of operons |CITS:[10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486][16153174]|. It is believed that  RcsF protein may also be capable of phosphorylating RcsB.
/
/The RcsB/RcsA complex has major affinity for binding sites of which RcsB is only one. The homodimers of RcsB activate transcription, interacting with the RNA polymerase, by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoter; the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5 |CITS:[16153174][11566985][15901715][15838058][10564486][12410838]|. The formation of heterodimers between  RcsB and the RcsA auxiliary protein stabilizes interactions with the distant binding sites |CITS:[10702265][8763957][16153174][17468243][12864862][17379715]|.
/
/The amount of RcsA protein is limited both by its rapid degradation by two proteases, Lon and ClpYQ, and by its low level of synthesis   |CITS:[16153174][7534408][3888955][3029041][1999391][8759878][1943696][14766922][12670962]|. 
/
/RcsB, which belongs to the two-component family, shows a helix-turn-helix motif for interaction with DNA in the C-terminal domain, while the the N-terminal domain is typical of the response regulator  |CITS:[16153174]|.
/
/Regulator protein RcsB is a member of the two-component regulatory system RcsC/RcsB |CITS [7855424][8366025][2836365]|. It is involved in the activation of colanic acid capsule synthesis (<i>cps</i>) and cell division (<i>ftsZ</i>) genes |CITS [10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486]|.Based on its homology to other regulator proteins in E. coli, it is believed that the RcsB protein is activated through phosphorylation, probably by the sensor protein RcsC |CITS [9209051]|. However, direct phosphorylation of RcsB by RcsC has not been shown. The RcsF protein may also be capable of phosphorylating RcsB. Once activated, the RcsB protein is a positive regulator of capsule synthesis and cell division |CITS [10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486]|. Regulator protein RcsB complexes with the RcsA protein (forming a heterodimer) for capsule synthesis activation |CITS [10702265][1943696][7855424]|. RcsB activates the <i>fts</i> genes independently (in the form of a homodimer) |CITS [1597415]|. 
/
/RcsB is a member of the LuxR/UhpA protein family.

COMMENT - PhoB is a dual transcription regulator that activates expression of the Pho regulon in response to environmental P<sub>i</sub>. The Pho regulon includes operons and genes whose products are involved in phosphorus uptake and metabolism |CITS:[8432742][8755861][17020555]|. Expression of the periplasmic binding proteins for peptide transport, OppA and DppA, is repressed by PhoB |CITS:[1478454]|. 
/
/PhoB is a response regulator and belongs to the two-component system PhoR/PhoB. Under phosphate limitation conditions the inner membrane sensor kinase PhoR autophosphorylates. Subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to PhoB results in activation of PhoB |CITS:[2693738]|. When phosphate is in excess, autophosphorylation of PhoR is inhibited and PhoB-P is dephosphorylated. This negative regulation requires in addition to PhoR an intact Pst system and PhoU |CITS:[8691745]|. In the absence of PhoR, cross-regulation of PhoB by CreC or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of PhoB in response to carbon sources |CITS:[1551836][2228961]|. 
/
/PhoB consists of two functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated, and the C-terminal output domain, which binds to DNA and interacts with the &sigma;<sup>70</sup> subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS:[8648643][8422984]|. The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors |CITS:[9199401]|. Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain, and phosphorylation relieves inhibition |CITS:[11073900]|. The 3D structure of the receiver domain |CITS:[9878437]| and of two constitutively active mutants of this domain |CITS:[17182055]| and the 3D structure of the output domain have been solved |CITS:[9016718]|.
/
/PhoB binds to the Pho box, which has been described as two direct 11-bp repeats consisting of successive 7-bp direct repeats followed by an A/T-rich region of 4 bp, situated 10 bp upstream of the -10 region |CITS:[3054125][12015152][3537313]|. The <i>pho</i> promoters contain functional -10 sequences but lack the consensus -35 sequence |CITS:[2651888]|.
/
/The 3D structure of the PhoB effector domain in complex with its target DNA sequence reveals a novel tandem arrangement in which several monomers bind head to tail to successive 11-bp direct repeat sequences, coating one face of the double helix |CITS:[12015152][16154092]|.

COMMENT - HU protein for "<b>H</b>eat <b>u</b>nstable protein," is a small DNA-bending protein considered a global regulatory protein that shares properties with histones, which play an important role in nucleoid organization |CITS:[10515926][10551881][10947847][19245936]| and regulation |CITS:[16258062][11254141][19194530][9218807][15289461][9192630]|. 
/
/HU is a heterodimer formed by an &alpha;-subunit and a &beta;-subunit that are encoded by the <i>hupA</i> and <i>hupB</i> genes, respectively |CITS:[3312963][3069589][6987059][2187099][2001682]|, which are differentially stimulated during cold shock |CITS:[11967080]|. It is a transcriptional dual regulator. HU-1 (HupB) and HU-2 (HupA) are closely related but differ by 28 residues, and they have a high content of hydrophobic residues represented mostly by alanine. There is no sequence homology between the proteins HU-1 and HU-2 compared to any of the five histones of different eukaryotes |CITS:[6987059]|. Three dimeric forms exist in <i>Escherichia coli</i>: two homodimers, HU&alpha;(2) and HU&beta;(2), and a heterodimer, HU&alpha;-&beta; |CITS:[12875839]|. The crystal structure DNA-HU&alpha;-&beta; complex has been resolved |CITS:[17360520]|. In the presence of poly(P), HupA is efficiently degraded by Lon  |CITS:[17543195]|. The presence of HU depends on the phase of growth |CITS:[10515926]| and it is distributed uniformly in the nucleoid |CITS:[10947847]|. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature. 
/
/HU belongs to a family of DNA architectural proteins and acts mostly as a regulatory or accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex |CITS:[12372591][17259223][1925023]|. For example, HU introduces negative supercoiling in covalently closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I |CITS:[222478][1579448]|. HU protein has been shown to be involved in DNA replication |CITS:[9171392][12366835][1879696]|, and the formation of transcription foci |CITS:[20010798]|, modulates the binding of IHF to oriC |CITS:[1425583]|, and stabilizes the DnaA oligomer bound to oriC |CITS:[18179598]|. As another example, HU is required for the expression of the sigma S factor |CITS:[11251825]|. Recently, Oberto et al. showed that HU also plays an important role in the regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress: osmolarity, acid stress, SOS induction, and anaerobiosis |CITS:[19194530][19127382]|.
/
/HU binds DNA without sequence specificity and with low affinity, but at low concentrations HU induces bends and at high concentrations HU induces the formation of rigid filaments |CITS:[10508175][2001682][10519118][10551881][18586040]|.

COMMON-NAME - YoeB-YefM toxin-antitoxin complex and DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - 17170003:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN:3440623175:asantos
COMMENT - YefM is a transcriptional DNA-binding autorepressor for the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon. In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin |CITS:[17170003]|. YefM can bind alone with low affinity to the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operator, but together with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM |CITS:[17170003]|. YoeB enhances the interaction with YefM by affecting the YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site and reducing basal expression of the <i>yefM-yoeB</i> operon |CITS:[17170003][19028895]|.
/
/The <i>yefM</i> gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms |CITS:[14727089]| and <i>yefM-yoeB</i> is upregulated in persister cells |CITS:[16768798]|; it is probable that derepression of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> autoregulation occurs in these circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with the YefM-YoeB-operator interaction |CITS:[19028895]|.
/
/The operator site 5' of <i>yefM-yoeB</i> comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp |CITS:[17170003]|,  which was suggested to be  crucial for the correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at the two repeats |CITS:[19028895]|. This sequence organization is common in <i>yefM-yoeB</i> regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation |CITS:[17170003]|.
/
/Nevertheless, YefM originally was described as a native unstructured protein |CITS:[14672926]|; later it was reevaluated as experimental, and modeling data have demonstrated that the protein is at least partially folded |CITS:[17170003][11735370]| and dimeric |CITS:[17170003]|.
/
/The YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with the YoeB toxin (YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB) |CITS:[15980067][16109374]|. The tertiary structure of the YoeB toxin and the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB complex has been described |CITS:[16109374]|. In the complex, one C terminus in the YefM homodimer is unfolded and the other one shows an &alpha;-helical conformation and conceals the endoribonuclease fold of YoeB. Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly |CITS:[19028895]|.
/
/YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif, but instead a pair of basic residues, R10 and R31, conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by the YefM-YoeB complex |CITS:[12603745][19028895][ 16109374]|.

COMMENT - The FlhD and FlhC proteins are transcriptional factors and can form homodimers independently (FlhD2 and FlhC2)  |CITS:[7961507]|, and the assembly of these homodimers results in the formation of heterotetramers (FlhD2C2)  |CITS:[7961507][12144778][15941987]|. The complex transcription factor FlhD2C2 is the principal regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration  |CITS:[12144778][15941987]|. This heterotetrameric regulator activates class II genes involved in the flagellar basal body |CITS:[12144778][15941987][7961507][10650844]|,  proteins of the export machinery, the flagellar &sigma; subunit (FliA), and its anti-&sigma; factor, FlgM |CITS:[12144778][15941987][15516564]|. Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in the literature. A microarray analysis showed that the master regulator, FlhD2C2, regulates several nonflagellar genes,  but the direct effect has not been determined. 
/
/FlhD and FlhC are part of the unusual <i>flhDC</i> operon that encodes two transcriptional regulators |CITS:[7961507][2832369]|. The expression of the <i>flhDC</i> master operon is multirregulated by several systems including those that respond to high osmolarity |CITS:[7642497]|, catabolic repression |CITS:[10601207]|, quorum sensing |CITS:[11929534]|, synthesis of type 1 fimbriae |CITS:[12123461]|, the histone-like nucleoid protein |CITS:[8071234][10601207]|, heat shock, etc.
/
/The flagellar regulator activates transcription of class II genes by overlapping the -35 box of the promoters |CITS:[15941987][12144778][7961507]|. The binding targets for FlhD2C2 consist of two repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each heterodimer (FlhDC) binds  to one of these conserved sequences, which are separated by a 10- to 11-bp spacer |CITS:[15941987][12144778]|. 
/
/The flagellar regulator is conformed by two FlhD subunits and two FlhC subunits, as a heterotetramer |CITS:[16337229]|, while FlhD is constituted by two domains: the N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and the C terminal is a highly flexible domain contain the DNA-binding (helix-turn-helix motif) region |CITS:[16337229][11169099]|. FlhC is constituted by two domains; arrangement of the domains is unique in the FlhC family |CITS:[16337229]|. The crystal structure of FlhDC has been solved to 3 &Aring; resolution |CITS:[16337229]| .

COMMENT - The "<i><b>E.</b> coli</i> <b>m</b>ultidrug <b>r</b>esistance <b>r</b>egulator" |CITS:[1409590][7730261]|, EmrR, negatively regulates the transcription of genes that code for multidrug resistance pumps that extrude structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents from the cell |CITS:[7730261][11321589]| and possibly it also represses a gene that codes for  a porin |CITS:[11321589]|.  When EmrR is overexpressed (the <i>emrR</i> gene in multicopy), it is able to repress the <i>marRAB</i> operon, which encodes two transcriptional regulators |CITS:[8521301]|.  
/
/EmrR, which is also known as MprA, "<b>m</b>icrocin <b>p</b>roduction <b>r</b>egulation, locus <b>A</b>" |CITS:[2152912]|, has also been shown to be a repressor of plasmid-encoded genes involved in microcin biosynthesis |CITS:[2152912] [1840583][9484896]|. Microcins are low-molecular-weight polypeptide antibiotics |CITS:[4071]|.
/
/The EmrR dimer binds 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide <i>m</i>-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and carbonyl cyanide <i>p</i>-(trifluoro-methoxy)phenylhydrazone, predicted ligands of the EmrAB pump, with high affinity |CITS:[10438794]|. Binding of these agents interferes with the ability of EmrR to bind DNA |CITS:[10991887]|. This dimeric protein |CITS:[10438794]| recognizes and binds an imperfect inverted repeat DNA sequence |CITS:[10991887]|.
/
/EmrR belongs to the MarR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[8521301]|, which respond to a variety of phenolic compounds and are found in gram-positive and gram-negative species as well as in mycobacteria |CITS:[8521301]|. The proteins of this family have a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif at the center |CITS:[9141683]|, while the ligand-binding domain is possibly located at the N-terminal domain |CITS:[10438794]|. EmrR shows 28% and 47% identity and similarity, respectively, to the MarR protein |CITS:[8521301]|.
/
/Overproduction of EmrR from a multicopy plasmid causes a mutator phenotype that includes an increase in frameshift and base substitution mutations |CITS:[15225322]|. 
/
/<i>emrR</i> is the first gene of the <i>emrRAB</i> operon whose transcription is induced by antimicrobial agents such as salicylic acid,  CCCP, and nalidixic acid, among others; induction requires the repressor of the operon EmrR |CITS:[7730261]|. Expression of <i>emrR</i> is not osmoregulated |CITS:[1840583]|.

COMMON-NAME - HipB DNA-binding transcriptional repressor complex
CITATIONS - 8021189:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN:3367241761:asantos
COMMENT - The transcriptional repressor HipB, for "<b>Hi</b>gh <b>p</b>ersistence," is negatively autoregulated and controls the transcription of a critical persistence factor |CITS:[19129642][15807669][15576765][1715862][14622409][15308767]|. <i>hipB</i> foms an operon with <i>hipA</i>, and the products of this operon are classified as a toxin (HipA)-antitoxin (HipB) system. This HipAB system is involved in the high persistence, which is the capacity of the bacteria to survive prolonged exposure to antibiotics |CITS:[15308767][17001682]|, and Kawano et al. also showed that this system is important for survival during the long-term stationary phase |CITS:[19129642][15807669][15576765]|. 
/
/The crystal structure of the HipB-HipA-DNA complex (2.68&Aring;) has been solved  |CITS:[19150849]|. The complex is tetrameric and is comprised of a HipB homodimer that interacts with DNA sandwiched by a monomer of HipA on each side  |CITS:[19150849]|. In the HipB-HipA complex each monomer of HipA interacts with two monomers of HipB |CITS:[19150849][19622872]|. HipB is an antitoxin that counteracts and neutralizes the HipA toxin, and HipA is toxic in the absence of its binding partner HipB |CITS:[19150849][8021189][1715862]|. Although HipA does not bind the Hip regulatory region, it plays an indirect role via its binding to HipB. 
/
/HipB contains a helix-turn-helix motif near the N terminus and is a Cro-like, DNA-binding protein. It binds to four operator sites with the conserved inverted repeat sequence motif TATCCN8GGATA, and its binding occurs cooperatively and almost simultaneously on the same face of the DNA helix. HipB forms dimers in solution  |CITS:[8021189][19150849]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional activator FUR, for "<b>F</b>erric <b>U</b>ptake <b>R</b>egulation,"  is capable of controlling its own synthesis |CITS:[3079747][17921503][10411720][2836193]| and controls the transcription of genes involved in iron homeostasis |CITS:[11282473][11101675][12475930][9575233][17921503][8407793][10411720][2644221][15101990][2162465][3294800]| and a minor sigma factor that initiates transcription of ferric citrate transport genes in response to the presence of periplasmic iron(III) dicitrate |CITS:[17921503][12860393][9575233]|. This regulator also participates in the regulation of transcription of many other genes involved in different cellular functions: flagellum chemotaxis |CITS:[8107138]|, methionine biosynthesis |CITS:[8107138]|, acid and oxidative stresses |CITS:[8412671][11101675]|, metal ion stress |CITS:[11466284][17120142][12480884]|, resistance to cobalt and nickel |CITS:[17129142]|, the tricarboxylic acid cycle |CITS:[9418241][15659676]|, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis |CITS:[11101675]|, respiration |CITS:[8107138][9418241][15659676]|, porins |CITS:[15659676]|, purine metabolism |CITS:[8107138]|, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate biosynthesis |CITS:[2139473]|, phage DNA packaging |CITS:[11101675]|, etc. 
/
/FUR is a transcriptional repressor but also can be an activator; the positive regulation of this regulator  is mediated by the indirect effect of RhyB, which is an antisense small RNA |CITS:[17216355][12975324][16982641][16199566][11917098][14617150]|.
/
/FUR is a sensor  of  the concentration of intracellular iron, and the genetic repression occurs when the physiological inducer, iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), binds to FUR. This cofactor is required for DNA binding |CITS:[16216078][17216355]|. FUR also is considered a  metalloregulatory protein and can sense different  divalent metal ions, such as Zn(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), Co(II), and Mn(II) |CITS:[3294800][10350474][17216355][11895294][16216078][16690618][19023664]|. On the other hand, D'Autraux et al. showed that nitric oxide, a radical that is potentially toxic, inhibits  the DNA binding of this repressor |CITS:[16417522][12475930]|.
/
/In the presence of iron, FUR binds in tandem to possible inverted repeat sequences in the  intergenic region to repress transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the regulated promoter. The FUR-binding sites were previously represented as regions of 19 bp, which were determined by footprinting of several promoter sequences |CITS:[3294800][2644221][8107138][2015825]|. Different aligments and computational analysis of these sequences showed different overlapping 15-bp sequences: TGATAATnATTATCA, consisting of two inverted repeats of 7 bp separated by 1 bp |CITS:[12374814][17921503]|. Experimental support for this consensus sequence was obtained from footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis experiments, analysis of the affinity and stoichiometry of DNA binding, gel retardation assays, etc. |CITS:[12374814][12644489]|. Currently there are different interpretations and models to explain how FUR could overlap inverted repeats in tandem |CITS:[12374814][17921503][12644489][16443380]|.

COMMENT - ArgP, "<b>arg</b>inine <b>p</b>rotein," controls the transcription of genes involved in the arginine transport system and genes involved in DNA replication. DNA replication is also regulated directly by ArgP when it binds to three 13-mers located in the origin of replication (OriC), blocking the DNA opening by DnaA and inhibiting this cellular process |CITS:[2034653], [2208289],[ 1733927]|. DNA binding by ArgP is prevented when the serine protease Do (DegP) hydrolyzes this transcriptional regulator |CITS: [8335089]|.

/To activate transcription, ArgP recognizes AT-rich DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein activates genes involved in replication, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS: [9254708], [9819053]|. However, the activity of ArgP depends on arginine and lysine to regulate genes involved in arginine metabolism. These amino acids, which bind to ArgP, do not seem to help the protein to form dimers or to bind to DNA, but they contribute to recruitment of the RNA polymerase and in forming the open complex. However, only the ArgP-arginine complex can produce transcripts, whereas ArgP-lysine appears to inhibit transcription |CITS: [17504942], [15150242]|.
/
/ArgP, which belongs to the LysR family, has a helix-turn-helix motif located close to the N terminus. Members of the LysR family that show considerable homology to ArgP are AmpR from <i>Citrobacter freundii</i>, MetR from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serotype Typhimurium, and NhaR from <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> |CITS: [2034653]|
/
/The expression of <i>argP</i> is induced by PhoB under phosphate starvation |CITS: [10589831]|. Contrary to the suggestion made by |CITS: [10600368]|, |CITS:[15150242]| has suggested that </i> argP</i> is not autoregulated.
/
/ArgP is also called IciA ( for "<b>i</b>nhibitor of <b>c</b>hromosome <b>i</b>nitiation") |CITS: [2034653]|.

COMMENT - MntR, "<b>Mn<sup>2+</sup></b> <b>t</b>ransport <b>r</b>egulator," is a repressor that senses manganese and  negatively controls the transcription of MntH, which is involved in manganese transport |CITS:[11466284]||.
/
/This protein belongs to the DtxR family. The members of this family have three domains: an N-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix motif, which binds to DNA; a central domain for dimerization and metal ion binding; and a C-terminal alpha-spectrin SH3-like domain. However, MntR lacks the SH3-like domain |CITS:[11466284]|.
/
/The 3D structure of apo-MntR has been solved. The protein dimerizes via its C-terminal domain. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains are connected by a long &alpha;-helical linker |CITS:[19701940]|. The N-terminal domain is expected to bind two manganese ions per monomer, in analogy to BsMntR from <i>B. subtilis</i>, which has been crystallized with and without bound manganese |CITS:[12847518][17118401]|. All residues involved in manganese binding in BsMntR ar conserved in MntR |CITS:[19701940]|.

COMMENT - ZntR, "<b>z</b>i<b>n</b>c <b>t</b>ransport <b>r</b>egulator," regulates a gene involved in the Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) transport systems |CITS:[10048032]|.
/

COMMENT - Fis, "<b>f</b>actor for <b>i</b>nversion <b>s</b>timulation", is a small DNA-binding and bending protein whose main role appears to be the organization and maintenance of nucleoid structure through direct DNA binding and by modulating gyrase |CITS:[18340041][11812843]| and topoisomerase I production |CITS:[17233826]|, as well as regulation of other proteins that modulate the nucleoid structure, such as CRP, HNS, and HU. Fis directly modulates several cellular processes, such as transcription, chromosomal replication, DNA inversion, phage integration/excision, and DNA transposition |CITS:[1484481][11278071]|.
/
/As a transcriptional regulator, Fis regulates the expression of many genes involved in translation (rRNA and tRNA genes), virulence, biofilm formation, energy metabolism, stress response, central intermediary metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, transport, cell structure, carbon compound metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis |CITS:[17768236][1484481][11555281]|. A transcriptome analysis has shown that transcription of approximately 21% of genes is modulated directly or indirectly by Fis |CITS:[18340041]|.  
/
/Fis, together with proteins such as HNS, HU, IHF, and Dps, is one of the largest components of the nucleoid. A ChIP-chip analysis has shown that Fis binds to 894 DNA regions in the genome, which results in two sites of Fis per supercoiling domain. These regions include both intergenic regions and regions within genes, and not all genes to which Fis binds are affected by this protein, a fact that is in agreement with the primary role assigned to Fis in maintenance of nucleoid structure |CITS:[18340041]|.
/
/Under optimal growth conditions, Fis is the dominant DNA-binding protein in the cell. Up to 60 000 copies of the protein can be found in a single cell under log phase, but it is nearly imperceptible in stationary phase (<100 molecules per cell) |CITS:[10515926]|. Fis bends the DNA between 40 and 90&deg; |CITS:[1484481]|. This bending stabilizes the DNA looping to regulate transcription and to promote DNA compaction |CITS:[17045294][9642081]|. 
/
/The crystal structure of Fis has been solved by several research groups |CITS:[11183780][1946369][ 1986310][ 9362499]|, and they have shown that this protein has an &alpha;-helical core of four helices (A to D). The C-terminal domain contains the C and D helices, forming a helix-turn-helix motif, characteristic of many DNA-binding proteins. The N-terminal domain has the A helix and a flexible &beta;-hairpin arm, which are involved in DNA inversion; this region appears to make contact with the DNA invertase Hin in the invertasome structure |CITS:[9362499][1484481]|.
/
/As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of many cellular processes, expression of <i>fis</i> is regulated by several systems and at different levels. At the transcription level, Fis is autoregulated, induced by high supercoiling levels |CITS: [11029698]|, and regulated by both growth rate-dependent and stringent control systems that require the presence of a GC motif downstream of the -10 region |CITS: [1547773]|.
/
/Transcription of <i>fis</i> is also regulated by the availability of the nucleotide triphosphate CTP, which is the nucleotide with which transcription of <i>fis</i> is initiated and whose largest concentration is seen during log phase, a fact that correlates with the pattern of <i>fis</i> expression. If transcription of this gene is initiated with an A or a G instead of a C, transcription is induced at the same level in early stationary phase rather than in log phase |CITS:[ 15385561]|. 
/
/A promoter that does not transcribe any ORF is located upstream of the promoter that transcribes <i>fis</i> and in the opposite direction. Under RNA polymerase limitation, both promoters compete for the protein. This might be a type of <i>fis</i> regulation expression, but there is no evidence to support this claim |CITS:[ 11279109]|.
/
/DksA, a protein that is associated with RNA polymerase in regulating transcription, inhibits transcription of <i>fis</i> by increasing the inhibitory effects of ppGpp, decreasing the lifetime of the RNA polymerase-<i>fis</i> promoter complex, and increasing the sensitivity to the CTP nucleotide |CITS:[ 16885445]|.
/
/BipA is a protein required for <i>fis</i> translation; this protein appears to destabilize the strong interaction between the 5 end of the untranslated region of the <i>fis</i> mRNA and the ribosome |CITS:[15297874]|. 
/
/In a specific way and with tight binding affinity, Fis recognizes and binds as a dimer to sites that have poorly related sequences. However, a very degenerated consensus sequence has been proposed for Fis sites, with only a subset of common nucleotides. This consensus sequence shows a core binding site of 15 bp with partial dyad symmetry |CITS:[1484481]|. This sequence presents only four highly conserved nucleotides, a G and a C at the 1st and at the 15th nucleotide, respectively, and a pyrimidine (A or G) and a purine (T or C) at the 5th and 11th positions, respectively. The central region commonly presents an AT-rich sequence |CITS:[ 18178221][ 9396807]|. Some of these sites have internal sequences that are potential methylation targets, 5-GATC-3, suggesting that under some circumstances Fis binding is controlled by methylation |CITS:[1320613]|.

COMMENT - 
/NikR, "<b>Ni</b>c<b>k</b>el-<b>r</b>esponsive repressor," is a tetramer and consists of two domains. The crystal structures of the C-terminal domain, apo-NikR, nickel-activated NikR, and NikR in complex with its operator DNA have been solved |CITS:[12970756][16945905][18193897]|. The C-terminal 83 amino acids form the tetrameric core, which carries the high-affinity nickel-binding site and resembles the ACT fold of the ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate mutase, TyrA) family. Two N-terminal domains intertwine to form a dimeric DNA-binding ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain |CITS:[10595554]|. The two RHH DNA-binding domains flank the tetrameric core of the protein |CITS:[16945905]|.
/
/The NikR tetramer contains four high-affinity nickel-binding sites located at the subunit interfaces of the C-terminal domain and additional low-affinity metal-binding sites |CITS:[12401498][12401490][17397155][18379702][16945905][15287730]|. The coordination of the nickel ion bound to the high-affinity site depends on binding to DNA. The nickel ion is bound in a four-coordinate planar conformation to NikR in solution and in a six-coordinate conformation to NikR bound to DNA |CITS:[12524532]|.
/
/NikR mediates two levels of repression. Saturation of the high-affinity nickel-binding sites at nickel concentrations in the picomolar range leads to substantial binding to the <i>nik</i> operator and a low level of constitutive repression, while nickel binding to the low-affinity sites at higher nickel concentrations (in the nanomolar range) leads to a large increase in operator binding and strong repression |CITS:[12401498][18193897][19319388]|. His48 and His110 are the residues that participate in the low-affinity Ni(II)-binding response |CITS:[20583753]|.
/
/In addition to the four high-affinity nickel-binding sites, the crystal structure reveals two binding sites for potassium ions, bridging the metal- and DNA-binding domains |CITS:[16945905]|. It is still disputed whether these sites actually resemble the low-affinity binding sites for nickel ions or whether these sites function as potassium-binding sites |CITS:[15826657][16945905]|. Molecular simulations on the EcNikR structure suggest that binding of NikR to DNA is more favorable when NikR contains K<sup>+</sup> |CITS:[19621966]|, and the allosterically activated DNA-binding conformation of NikR is stabilized by K<sup>+</sup> |CITS:[16945905][19621966]|. Moreover, DNA binding of NikR is abolished in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> |CITS:[20088519]|.

/The "<b>Cu</b> <b>e</b>fflux <b>r</b>egulator", CueR, regulates genes related to the primary copper homeostasis system |CITS:[15773991][11167016][11222619][10915804]| in response to the presence of copper, silver, or gold ions |CITS:[15773991][12832075][12446701]|.
/
/The crystal structures of CueR dimers bound to Cu<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, or Au<sup>+</sup> have been solved |CITS:[12958362]|. Each monomer consists of three domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain carrying two helix-turn-helix motifs, a central dimerization domain, and a C-terminal metal-binding domain. The DNA-binding and dimerization domains are characteristic of the MerR family of proteins. The dimerization domain contains a 10-turn &alpha;-helix that forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with the helix of the other monomer. The metal-binding domain contains an unusual metal receptor site in which the bound metal is inaccessible to the solvent. The metal ion is bound with a linear coordination to two conserved cysteine residues. This dithiolate coordination confers the metal ion selectivity for +1 ions |CITS:[12958362]|. The sensitivity of CueR for copper(I) ions is extremely high (in the zeptomolar range), which corresponds to less than one atom per cell. Apparently it is the task of CueR and CopA to clear the toxic copper ions rapidly from the cytoplasm into the periplasmic space |CITS:[12958362]|.
/
/CueR activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of promoters and represses it by binding downstream of the transcription start site |CITS:[11136469]|. CueR  binds to a 19-bp sequence containing two 7-bp inverted repeats separated by a 7-bp spacer |CITS:[11136469]|.  Binding occurs <i>in vitro</i> in both the presence and the absence of copper ions. Holo-CueR binds more strongly to DNA than apo-CueR and with a higher conformational flexibility |CITS:[19651042]|. Both holo- and apo-CueR bend DNA |CITS:[19651042]|. The formation of permanganate-sensitive transcription complexes requires copper ions |CITS:[11136469]|.

COMMENT - DcuR regulates several genes involved in C4-dicarboxylate metabolism |CITS: [9973351]|. In addition, a recent microarray-based global transcriptional profiling study suggested that the DcuR regulon could comprise at least 39 genes, including some involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and some involved in anaerobic nitrate and nitrite respiration |CITS: [12366850]|.
/
/DcuR is the response regulator in the two-component regulatory system DcuR/DcuS and is a member of the CitAB subfamily of His protein kinases |CITS: [9973351] [9765574]|. Autophosphorylation of DcuS is stimulated by C4-dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate, and the phosphate group is transferred to DcuR, which is converted to a dimeric form |CITS: [15073297][12167640][14996819]|.
/
/This protein contains an N-terminal receiver domain that includes the aspartate residue (Asp-56) for phosphorylation and a C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding |CITS: [9973351][9765574]|. Two directly repeated hexameric DNA sequences that are highly enriched in A/T residues have been proposed to be the sites recognized by a DcuR dimer |CITS: [14996819]|.
/
/Both <i>dcuR</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>dcuS</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, are organized in an operon that is located upstream of the <i>dcuB-fumB</i> operon, whose expression is activated by DcuR |CITS: [14996819]|. The <i>dcuSR</i> operon contains two promoters, an external one that transcribes both genes and an internal one that only transcribes to <i>dcuR</i> and that is activated by CRP |CITS: [17618229]|. Neither of these two promoters is regulated by DcuR |CITS: [15995204]|. The full operon is repressed by  nitrate acting through the NarXL regulatory system, so that <i>E.coli</i> will use nitrate as a respiratory electron acceptor before fumarate |CITS: [15995204]|.]|

COMMENT - The "<b>p</b>henyl<b>a</b>cetic <b>a</b>cid" regulator |CITS:[9748275]|,  PaaX,  is a transcriptional repressor that participates in controlling transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the catabolism of an aromatic compound, phenylacetic acid (PA) |CITS:[10766858]|. When PaaX is overexpressed, it causes elevated levels of mutations in the genome; therefore, it is a candidate to regulate DNA replication, recombination, or repair |CITS:[15225322]|. 
/
/PaaX contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding that is similar to the motif found in the N terminal of members of the GntR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[ 9748275]|. Members of this family share similar N-terminal DNA-binding domains but are classified into four subfamilies according to their divergence in their C-terminal domains, which are involved in effector binding and oligomerization |CITS:[ 11756427]|.
/
/Homology with PaaX has been found in other bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, <i>Bacillus halodurans</i>, and  <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp., among others |CITS:[10766858]|.
/
/The majority of work concerning PaaX has been done in <i>E. coli</i> W, in which has been found the DNA-binding sites for PaaX, including a site upstream of the <i>paaXY</i> operon |CITS:[15159386]|. The DNA-binding consensus of PaaX consists of a palindromic sequence of 6 bp separated by about 27 bp |CITS:[15159386][16788190]|. This palindromic property of the PaaX site as well as the presence of a helix-turn helix motif in the protein have been the basis for suggestions that PaaX binds DNA as a dimer |CITS:[10766858][15159386]|.
/
/The binding of PaaX to DNA is inhibited by phenylacetyl-CoA, which is the product of the first catabolic step in PA degradation |CITS:[10766858][9748275]|.
/
/<i>paaX</i> is transcribed in an operon (<i>paaXY</i>) that is located in the genome downstream and in the same orientation as the <i>paaABCDEFGHIJK</i> operon, which is repressed by PaaX |CITS:[10766858]|.

COMMENT - AsnC is a transcriptional regulator that activates the expression of <i>asnA</i>, a gene involved in the synthesis of asparagine |CITS:[2864330][3909107]|. However, when asparagine is present the activation of <i>asnA</i> is turned off. On the other hand, AsnC is negatively autoregulated, but the presence of asparagine does not affect this regulation |CITS:[2864330]|.
/
/AsnC belongs to the AsnC family of regulatory proteins whose members are widely distributed in archaea and bacteria |CITS:[11523004]|. It has been postulated that AsnC is very ascient; it appears that it was present before the divergence of archea and bacteria |CITS:[11523004]|. This protein has a DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif in the N terminus and an effector-binding C-terminal domain |CITS:[16528101]|.
/
/A crystal structure of AsnC complexed with the ligand l-asparagine has been solved at 2.4-&Aring; resolution. The crystal structure shows an octamer with l-asparagine bound in a cleft at the interface between dimers; however, the octamer is formed in an l-asparagine-independent manner |CITS:[16528101]|. The octamer is composed of four dimers, each of which appears to recognize and bind an inverted repeat DNA sequence of 5 bp separated by 3 bp that are usually T or A base pairs. There are four AsnC sites in the divergent regulatory regions of <i>asnA</i> and <i>asnC</i>, and they are separated by 18 bp |CITS:[16528101][Suzuki03]|.
/
/The replication origin, <i>oriC</i>, is located between the <i>mioC</i> and <i>gidA</i> genes, and the <i>asnC</i> gene is immediately upstream of <i>mioC</i> in the genome |CITS:[2864330]|. The transcription of <i>asnC</i> sometimes traverses the origin of replication and continues into <i>gidA</i>, possibly explaining the effect on <i>gidA</i> expression |CITS:[ 2836709][2464126][2854096]|. Sometimes the transcription of <i>asnC</i> ends at a terminator located downstream of this gene or by the DnaA protein that binds to a DnaA box blocking the transcribing RNA polymerase |CITS:[2464126][2854096]|.
/
/Expression of <i>asnC</i> is regulated by nitrogen availability; under nitrogen-limiting conditions, Nac represses <i>asnC</i> |CITS:[11814655]|.

COMMENT - ArsR negatively controls the expression of the genes involved in arsenical and antimonite metals resistance whose expression is induced in the presence of these metals |CITS:[7860609][7721697][8764681][8576202]|. This protein is autoregulated; <i>arsR</i> is the first gene in the <i>arsRBC</i> operon that it regulates |CITS:[7721697]|. 
/
/ArsR belongs to the ArsR/SmtB family of transcriptional regulators that respond to a variety of metals |CITS:[12829264]|. ArsR has a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, a  metal-binding site |CITS:[8051064]|, and a dimerization domain |CITS:[9188467]|. The inducer-binding sites for the members of this family appear to have arisen by convergent evolution |CITS:[17897948]|. In ArsR the inducer-binding site contains three cysteine residues that bind arsenite and antimonite specifically and with high affinity |CITS:[8051064][8621591]|.
/
/Dimerization of ArsR is required for DNA binding and its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor |CITS:[9188467]|. The dimer recognizes and binds to a 12-2-12 inverted repeat |CITS:[12829264][8576202]|, but the binding of arsenic or antimonite to ArsR causes a conformational change in it, leading to dissociation from DNA and hence derepression |CITS:[8621591]|.

COMMENT - CytR, "<b>Cyt</b>idine <b>R</b>egulator," is a transcription factor required for transport and utilization of ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides |CITS:[7715459][8596434][8022285][1715855][9466254][9767576][14499937]|.
/
/The repressor CytR and the activator CRP, two dimeric proteins, interact to form a complex repressor nucleoprotein in the intergenic region. When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription  |CITS:[ 8736525][10766824][9086266][10320573][10766824][8764393][8816767]|.
/
/The CytR protein cannot act alone; the synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct interaction with CRP |CITS:[1962841][2170326][1649947]|. However, footprinting analyses showed that the dimers of CytR are flanked or "sandwiched" by two dimers of CRP |CITS:[1655726][10766824][10347150][8969182]|. At times CytR also repositions CRP to alternative DNA-binding sites that are not functional for activation |CITS:[ 8736525]|. 
/
/Gavigan et al. (1999) and Perini et al. (1996) showed that CytR binds in tandem in the regulated intergenic region |CITS: [10347150] [8969182]|. On the other hand, in 1997, Pedersen and Valentin-Hanses showed that CytR binds to octamer repeats, GTTGCATT in either the direct or inverted orientation and preferably separated by 2 or 3 bp |CITS: [9155036][15313602] [9466254]|. For this reason the length of the CytR DNA-binding site is variable.
/
/ Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, cytidine, binds to the CytR regulator and when cellular cAMP levels are high. CytR senses and binds cytidine, and when this happens the cooperativity of CytR and CRP is interrupted and the expression of genes is induced |CITS:[1655726][1715855]|.
/
/CytR belongs to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[1639817]|. Like the other members of this family, it has an N-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif for DNA binding and a C-terminal domain for dimerization, inducer binding |CITS:[1639817]|,  and protein contact to CRP |CITS:[9215632]|. Between these two domains, CytR has a disordered sequence that provides the HTH motif with freedom of movement |CITS: [9155036][9466254]|, which would allow this protein to interact with octameric half DNA-binding sites that could be arranged as inverted or  direct repeats and with different lengths of spacer regions |CITS:[9466254][9155036]|. This interdomain linker is protected from proteolytic digestion in the presence of CRP |CITS:[ 15313602]|.

COMMENT - MurR "<i>N</i>-acetyl <b>mur</b>amic acid <b>r</b>epressor," represses genes involved in the catabolism of cell wall sugars |CITS:[18723630]|. It represses transcription from the <i>murQ</i> promoter and also interferes with its own transcription. <i>murR</i> and <i>murQ</i> are unique and now well-known genes that are regulated by MurR. They are divergently orientated and expressed from nonoverlapping face-to-face (convergent) promoters, and their transcripts are complementary at their 5' ends |CITS:[18723630]|.
/
/MurR is a member of the RpiR/AlsR family of transcriptional regulators, whose members contain two domains, a highly conserved N-terminal HTH domain and a C-terminal SIS (<b><i>s</i></b>ugar phosphate <b><i>i</i></b>somerase/<b><i>s</i></b>ugar phosphate-binding) domain |CITS:[18723630][ 10203754]|. It forms a stable multimer (most likely a tetramer) and binds to two adjacent inverted repeats within the <i>murR/murQ</i> operator region, preventing recruitment of RNA polymerase.
/
/MurNAc-6-P is the effector of MurR. MurR carries a so-called SIS domain in its C terminal which is involved in MurNAc-6-P binding. Thus, the DNA-binding affinity of MurR is affected specifically by MurNAc-6-P. MurR functions as a repressor of the MurNAc pathway |CITS:[18723630]|.

COMMENT - The regulatory protein for "<b>u</b>ptake of <b>h</b>exose <b>p</b>hosphates," UhpA |CITS:[4902320]|, activates the transcription of a gene that codes for UhpT, a protein that transports many phosphorylated sugars into the cell |CITS:[6309737]|.
/
/UhpA is the response regulator in the unusual two-component regulatory system comprised of three proteins, UhpA/UhpB/UhpC, and is a member of the NarL subfamily of response regulators. The signal that triggers this signaling pathway is glucose 6-phosphate external. This sugar is sensed by UhpC, which interacts with UhpB to stimulate its autophosphorylation. Then, phosphorylated UhpB transfers the phosphate group to UhpA in Asp-54 to activate it |CITS:[11739766]|. UhpB unphosphorylated is able to dephosphorylate to UhpA |CITS:[11325944][11739766]|.
/
/UhpA has two modules: the receiver module, which contains the putative site of phosphorylation in the N-terminal domain |CITS:[7596290]|, and the activation module, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding in the C-terminal domain|CITS:[7596290][3042748]|. UhpA shows 30% identity with DctD |CITS:[3042748]|.
/
/The RNA polymerase RpoA and RpoD subunits are necessary for the transcriptional activation by UhpA |CITS:[10572130]|, which induces open complex formation, but the stabilization of this complex is CRP dependent |CITS:[10512697]|. These two regulatory proteins appear to stimulate the DNA binding of each other to the <i>uhpT</i> promoter |CITS:[10512697]|.
/
/Two UhpA dimers bind to two sites with different affinities upstream of <i>uhpT</i>. The weak site is essential for activation, and its occupancy is dependent on the occupancy of the strong site.

COMMENT - NsrR, the "<b>n</b>itrite-<b>s</b>ensitive <b>r</b>epressor" |CITS:[15458412]|, regulates genes involved in cell protection against nitric oxide (NO) |CITS:[16428390][18658270]|. A microarray analysis showed that this protein regulates directly or indirectly at least 30 genes, some of which are involved in protection against reactive nitrogen species that can be generated by NO |CITS:[17449618]|. A ChIP-chip analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis) revealed that NsrR regulates, in addition, genes involved in motility and/or biofilm development |CITS:[19656291]|. NsrR also appears to regulate &sigma;<sup>E</sup>-dependent genes in an RseA-independent manner |CITS:[17416652]|.
/
/NsrR belongs to the Rrf2 family |CITS:[15458412]|, which includes among others  the [2Fe-2S]-containing transcription factor IscR and the iron regulator RirA |CITS:[11742080],[12480909]|. These proteins have orthologs in a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria |CITS:[16261196]|. For DNA binding, NsrR has a helix-turn-helix  motif close to the N terminus and three cysteine residues to ligate a [2Fe-2S] cluster  close to the C terminus |CITS:[ 18989365]|.
/
/The binding site for NsrR has been described as a 23-bp (11-1-11) inverted repeat |CITS:[16428390][17720788]|, and in agreement with this kind of site, in <i>S. coelicolor</i> it has been demonstrated that this protein binds DNA as a homodimer |CITS:[18989365]|. ChIP-chip studies (chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis) allowed identification of over 60 potential binding sites for NsrR in <i>E. coli</i>. The analysis of these sites suggests that there are two types of sites: those comprising two copies of an 11-bp inverted repeat with 1-bp spacing, as previously described, and those which have a single copy of the 11-bp motif. It should be noted that the 11-bp motif is itself a partial palindrome, and it has been suggested that the two types of site are occupied by NsrR in different oligomeric states |CITS:[19656291]|. The form of the protein that binds DNA specifically is that bound to a [2Fe-2S] cluster, but when NO binds to the cluster, NsrR loses its DNA-binding activity |CITS:[18989365][18658270]|. 
/
/<i>nsrR</i> is the first gene in the <i>nsrR-rnr-rlmB-yjfI</i> operon; the second gene encodes an RNase that contributes to cellular  growth at low temperatures |CITS:[ 14622421]|, the third one encodes the 23S rRNA methyltransferase  |CITS:[ 11698387]|, and no function has been assigned for the fourth gene.  This operon is induced by cold shock as a result of mRNA stability, but the PNPase protein degrades this mRNA at the end of the acclimation phase |CITS:[ 14622421]|. Expression of <i>nsrR</i> is not subject to autoregulation |CITS:[16428390]|.

COMMENT - MetR participates in controlling several genes involved in methionine biosynthesis |CITS:[1943695]| and a gene involved in protection against nitric oxide |CITS:[9767577]|.
/
/Homocysteine, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of methionine |CITS:[2656646]|, binds to MetR and enhances the activity of some MetR-activated promoters (i.e., metE and glyA)  by enhancing  the affinity in DNA-binding sites |CITS:[ 8757744][ 1943695]|. But homocysteine is also able to decrease the activity of other promoters that are activated (i.e., metH, metA, and hmp)  or repressed (i.e., metR) by MetR |CITS:[ 2656646 ][2673243][ 1943695]|. The <i>glyA</i> and <i>hmp</i> genes are transcribed divergently  and have  a common regulatory region that contains two MetR DNA-binding sites. When homocysteine is present, MetR binds to two MetR sites and activates <i>glyA</i> and represses <i>hmp</i> transcription, but in the absence of homocysteine MetR binds only one site and activates <i>hmp</i> and represses <i>glyA</i> transcription |CITS:[9767577]|.
/
/MetR appears to first bind DNA and then homocysteine causes the effect on transcription |CITS:[2673243]|. The nitrosated compound <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) removes homocysteine by  nitrosation |CITS:[ 9767577 ]|. 
/
/The RNA polymerase and MetR interact for transcription activation, but distinct residues of RNA polymerase are involved in different promoters because the MetR-binding sites are located at different positions |CITS:[ 10986259][ 8757744]||. MetR, as a dimer |CITS:[ 2543976]|,  recognizes and binds a DNA sequence with dyad symmetry |CITS:[ 2543976][7608086]|.
/
/MetR belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[8257110]|. The members of this family have three domains: the N-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, a central domain involved in coinducer recognition, and a C-terminal domain required for both DNA binding and coinducer response |CITS:[8257110]|.
/
/It has been proposed that MetR has in the N-terminal domain a leucine zipper motif characteristic of many eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins used for protein dimerization |CITS:[2205852]|. Mutations in leucines of this motif inactivated MetR |CITS:[2205852]|, but a role of MetR dimerization for this motif has not been demonstrated  |CITS:[2205852]|.
/
/<i>metR/<i> and <i>metE</i> are divergently transcribed from overlapping promoters |CITS:[ 2543976]|.

COMMENT - RelB is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator which belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family of transcription factors |CITS:[14659018][17924660][18501926]| and it is an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the toxin |CITS:[9767574]|. RelB is part of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon, which specifies a toxin-antitoxin system, and it is autoregulated by its own products, RelB and RelE |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135][15768033]|. On the other hand, <i>relE</i> encodes a cytotoxin that is lethal or inhibitory to host cells |CITS:[9767574]|, and it also encodes a cofactor that enhances the repressor activity of RelB |CITS:[9767574][18501926][11274135][15768033]|.
/
/The <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon is induced upon entering nutritional starvation conditions, such as the stringent response or acid starvation |CITS:[11717402][11972253]|, while the level of RelB antitoxin is reduced as a result of Lon-dependent proteolysis. Consequently, RelE toxin is liberated, leading to cell growth arrest and eventually cell death |CITS:[12603745]|. The expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon under these conditions may have some as-yet-uncovered beneficial function |CITS:[9767574]|, or it might serve as a growth modulator during starvation or other types of stress without necessarily leading to cell death |CITS:[15768033]|. 
/
/RelE and RelB form a high-affinity complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry when RelB is in excess |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|. This interaction of RelE with RelB is essential for regulating the expression of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon and for neutralizing the toxic activity of RelE |CITS:[11274135]|. The ReB<sub>2</sub>-RelE complex represses transcription of the <i>relBE-hokD</i> operon |CITS:[18501926]| via strong cooperative binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region |CITS:[9767574][19747491]|. The 24-bp operator contains a hexad repeat (5'-[A/T]TGT[A/C]A-3') that is repeated twice on each strand |CITS:[18501926][19297318][19747491]|. The spacing between each half-site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions |CITS:[19747491]| between two RelB<sub>2</sub>-RelE heterotrimers. Only RelB makes contacts to the DNA and the RHH motif of RelB recognizes the four hexad repeats within the bipartite binding site. High affinity for DNA is only achieved in the presence of RelE |CITS:[18501926]|, which stabilizes the tetrameric form of RelB |CITS:[18501926]|. 
/
/When RelE is in excess, <i>relBE</i> transcription is stimulated |CITS:[18532983]|. It has been suggested, that excess RelE leads to the formation of a RelE<sub>2</sub>-RelB<sub>2</sub> complex that does not bind to the operator |CITS:[18532983][19747491]|.
/
/RelB possesses a well-folded core domain at its N terminus followed by a flexible region at its C terminus, a pattern typical of other antitoxins |CITS:[18501926]|. The C terminus is responsible for dimerization of the dimeric core domain in the assembly of the RelB tetramer |CITS:[18501926]|, and the N terminus is responsible for binding to the <i>relB</i> promoter region via its RHH domain |CITS:[18532983][18501926]|. 
/
/By using a low-toxicity mutant of RelE, RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup>, the protein could be purified for structural studies. RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> exhibits an &alpha;/&beta;-sandwich fold. Its C-terminal helix 4 lies next to a conserved positive charged cluster, the putative mRNA-binding site of RelE toxin. In a complex of RelE<sup>R81A/R83A</sup> with a C-terminal peptide of RelB (RelB<sub>c</sub>), this helix is displaced by helix 3 of RelB<sub>c</sub>, resulting in the neutralization of the positively charged cluster of RelE |CITS:[19297318]|.
/
/The interactions of the N- and C-terminal regions of RelB with RelE could be essential in the RelBE family, and the salt bridges observed between the central loop in RelB and the exposed loop in RelE may be a species-specific interaction |CITS:[15768033]|.
/
/The RelB-RelE complex in <i>Pyrococcus horikoshii</i> is heterotetrameric (RelB-RelE)<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[15768033]|, whereas in <i>E. coli</i> a RelB<sub>4</sub>-RelE<sub>4</sub> complex may form a tight association with two adjacent binding sites on the promoter, which could involve either DNA bending or DNA-induced protein conformational change |CITS:[18501926]|.
/
/Several homologs have been identified on the chromosome of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 as well as on those of other organisms, such as <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, and in the <i>E. coli</i> plasmid P307 |CITS:[ 9767574]|. Bacterial <i>relBE</i> systems are conserved in archaea, such as in <i>Methanococcus jannaschii</i>, <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, and <i>P. horikoshii</i> OT3 |CITS:[10633087]|. Alignment of the RelB homologs showed that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.
/
/The sequence alignment of the RelB homologs shows that these proteins are considerably more divergent than the RelE homologs |CITS:[9767574]|.
/
/Mutations in the <i>relB</i> gene confer a so-called delayed relaxed phenotype upon host cells |CITS:[5321960][326765][2990907]|, in which synthesis of stable RNA resumes approximately 10 min after the initiation of amino acid starvation |CITS:[9767574]|. These findings provided the first sign that the stringent response system might be connected to the MazEF and RelBE systems through the translation apparatus |CITS:[15809644]|.

COMMENT - KdpE is a transcriptional regulator involved in the regulation of genes involved in a high-affinity potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake system |CITS:[17536175][11931551][7855422]|. The genes of this system and their regulators are widely distributed among the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and archaea |CITS:[17536175]|. KdpE activates expression of the <i>kdpFABC</i> operon encoding the P-type ATPase KdpFABC, a high-affinity potassium transport system. 
/
/KdpE belongs to the two-component system KdpD/KdpE |CITS:[1532388]|. The operon containing both genes, <i>kdpE</i>, encoding the response regulator, and <i>kdpD</i>, encoding the sensor kinase, is located next to and in the same direction as an operon (<i>kdpFABC</i>) regulated by KdpE |CITS:[1532387]|. It has been suggested that sometimes the genes of the two operons are transcribed in only one transcript |CITS:[1532387]|. In some species the arrangement of these genes in the genome is different than in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[17536175]|. 
/
/KdpD exhibits both kinase and phosphatase activities towards KdpE |CITS:[9099740][11123681][9651326]|. Under K<sup>+</sup>-limiting conditions or under osmotic stress imposed by a salt, autophosphorylation of KdpD at His-673 is stimulated |CITS:[17536175][11016946][8223625]|. Subsequently, the phosphate group is transferred from KdpD to Asp-52 of KdpE |CITS:[8437514][1630317][9099740]|, leading to the dimerization and activation of KdpE |CITS:[16322582]|. At high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, the kinase activity of KdpD is inhibited |CITS:[11016946]|.
/
/Under salt stress, the universal stress protein UspC binds to KdpE and stabilizes the KdpD-KdpE-DNA complex; therefore, this system can be activated even though K<sup>+</sup> accumulates under this environmental condition |CITS:[19101563]|. In addition, expression of the <i>kdpFABC</i> operon is regulated by the phosphoryl group transfer chain Ntr-PTS: dephosphorylated enzyme IIA<sup>Ntr</sup> binds to KdpD, and this interaction strongly stimulates KdpD kinase activity |CITS:[19400808]|.
/
/KdpE is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators |CITS:[1532388][1970651]| and binds a 23-bp recognition sequence |CITS:[1630316]|. The crystal structure of KdpE with and without bound beryllium fluoride has been solved |CITS:[16322582]|.
/
/Overproduction of KdpE causes a drug resistance phenotype |CITS:[12618449]|.

COMMENT - MetJ represses the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of methionine |CITS:[16515535][1943695]|.
/
/MetJ belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix family of regulatory proteins. The typical motif of members of this family, the ribbon-helix-helix motif for DNA binding, has been observed in the crystalline structure of MetJ |CITS:[1406951]|. This motif is composed of a two-stranded antiparallel &beta;-ribbon that lies along the DNA major groove, two outer &alpha;-helices that interact with adjacent proteins along the DNA, and two inner &beta;-helices that form the subunit interface |CITS:[1406951]|.
/
/MetJ as a homodimer |CITS:[2994061][1406951]| recognizes and binds to an 8-bp DNA sequence called the met-box, which varies around a perfect palindromic consensus sequence |CITS:[6094549][2677754][3513164]|. MetJ finds its target sites rapidly by facilitated diffusion |CITS:[19289840]|. The affinity of MetJ to this site is enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) |CITS:[2677754][7880815]|, which is the end product of methionine biosynthesis and which binds MetJ to act as a corepressor |CITS:[16622061]|. The binding of AdoMet to MetJ creates an unusually long-range electrostatic interaction with the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA, raising the DNA affinity by at least 100-fold |CITS:[8087557][7862523]|. 
/
/The genes regulated by MetJ contain in their regulatory region two to five continuous met-boxes |CITS:[1771231]|, in which MetJ dimers interact with each other  |CITS:[2677754][1406951]|.

COMMENT - FNR is the primary transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through the regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism |CITS:[12754220][15659690]|. FNR also regulates the transcription of many genes with other functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynthesis, among others |CITS:[12754220][15659690]|.
/
/The cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth |CITS:[15547274]|, but its activity is regulated directly by oxygen. Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of  the protein that causes it to become activated |CITS:[11581261]|. Purification of [4Fe-4S]-FNR in an O<sub>2</sub>-free environment has been described |CITS:[19892202]|. The presence of O<sub>2</sub> results in inactivation of FNR via oxidation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster into the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS:[19261852][15547274][9177174]| and the disassembly of the dimer |CITS:[8576252]|. After prolonged O<sub>2</sub> exposure, the [2Fe-2S] cluster is destroyed, and apo-FNR, which lacks an Fe-S cluster, is the primary form of FNR under aerobiosis |CITS:[ 18055593][ 14730984]|. Nitric oxide is also able to inactivate FNR through the nitrosylation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster |CITS:[12093725]|.
/
/Under aerobiosis, the apo-FNR monomer is exposed and can be degraded by the ClpXP protease |CITS:[16243354]|. Two motifs of FNR appear to be necessary for this degradation, one located  in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region |CITS:[16243354]|.
/
/The activated FNR conformation is able to bind a specific palindromic sequence of DNA  with the consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA |CITS:[11771123][ 2677602]|. The G and the first T of each FNR half-site appears to interact with FNR residues Glu-209 and Ser-212 |CITS:[ 2136332]|. FNR activates the transcription from class I and class II promoters, in which the FNR-binding sites are located  around -61, -71, -82, or  -92 in class I  and around -41.5 in class II |CITS:[ 7592457]|.  In class I promoters the second N and in class II promoters the third N of the consensus FNR site tend to be an A-T |CITS:[ 12706827]|.
/
/During activation, three activating regions (AR) are surface exposed for contact with the polymerase and promote transcription. The AR1 region contacts with the &alpha; subunit |CITS:[ 10972822]|, the AR2 region makes contact with the &sigma<sup>70</sup> |CITS:[12374818]|, and the AR3 contacts the &alpha; NTD of the RNA polymerase |CITS:[ 11786011]|. The group amino acids Thr-118 with Ser-187; Lys-49 with Lys50; and Asp86 and Ile81 with Gly-85 are important for AR1, AR2, and AR3, respectively, to make contact with the RNA polymerase |CITS:[10972822][12374818][11786011]|. The monomer in the FNR dimer that makes contact with the RNA polymerase and the activating region in FNR that makes the contact depends on the class of promoter, class I or class II |CITS:[10972822][12374818][11786011]|.
/
/FNR belongs to the CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors whose members are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS:[ 14638413]|.  These proteins have an N-terminal sensory domain, a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization motif in between |CITS:[ 14638413]|. The sensory domain of FNR contains five cysteine residues, four of which are essential for linking the [4Fe-4S] cluster |CITS:[8497198]|. 
/
/Under anaerobic growth conditions, transcription of the <i>fnr</i> gene is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[17293415]|.

COMMENT - "<b>Tre</b>halose <b>r</b>epressor," TreR, acts as a repressor of operons involved in trehalose transport and degradation under osmotic stress |CITS:[8391102][1651549]|. In the presence of trehalose-6-phosphate and at low osmolarity levels, TreR derepresses an operon related to trehalose transport and catabolism |CITS:[9148912][2160944][8083158][7608078][19787122]|, while trehalose is inactive |CITS:[19787122]|.
/
/TreR occurs as a homodimer and is composed of two domains: an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, and a carboxy-terminal domain involved in effector recognition |CITS:[9148912]|. This transcription factor is a regulator that belongs to the LacI/GalR family (specifically, to the HutC subfamily) |CITS:[12598694][9865945]|. This regulator binds to a 14-bp-long palindromic sequence |CITS:[7608078][9148912]|.
/
/The crystal structure of the trehalose repressor (TreR) in a complex with its inducer trehalose-6-phosphate has been published |CITS:[9865945]|.
/
/Based on saturation transfer difference NMR, it was shown that both trehalose-6-phosphate and trehalose bind to TreR with similar affinities. Titration showed that trehalose-6-phosphate binds more strongly than trehalose |CITS:[19787122]|.
/
/The ratio of dissociation of TreR [<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>(trehalose)]/[<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>(trehalose/6-phosphate)] is  >/-2,800, and its rate of association (<i>k</i><sub>on</sub>) is >/-10<sup>2</sup> |CITS:[19787122]|.

COMMENT - LexA represses the transcription of  several genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication |CITS:[2994755][10760155 ]| as well as its own synthesis |CITS:[ 6990417]|. This regulation is known as the SOS response |CITS:[2994755]|.
/
/When DNA is damaged, the RecA coprotease binds to the single-stranded DNA in the damaged region to form a filament |CITS:[ 18497818 ][ 17364684]|.  This filament interacts with the LexA dimer to activate its self-cleavage activity by an allosteric mechanism, causing the dissociation of LexA from its DNA targets and the induction of the SOS regulon for the repair of broken DNA |CITS:[ 18234215][1911941]|.
/
/LexA is widely distributed in bacteria, and it appears that it emerged from the  gram-positive group |CITS:[15528664]|. It shows two domains, the N-terminal domain involved in DNA binding via a helix-turn-helix |CITS:[ 8076591]| and the C-terminal domain involved in dimerization and in cleavage activity |CITS:[11551506][2968919]|.
/
/To repress transcription, LexA blocks the access of RNA polymerase to target promoters |CITS:[ 7027255 ]|.
/
/LexA dimer |CITS:[10671501]| recognizes and binds to  an imperfect inverted repeat DNA sequence called the LexA box or SOS box |CITS:[ 14630651][ 6371470 ]|. Although, the majority of the LexA-regulated genes have only one SOS box, some have two or three boxes which sometimes overlap |CITS:[ 18524933]|.
/
/<i>lexA</i> is the first gene in the <i>lexA-dinF</i> operon |CITS:[ 6298183]|. <i>dinF</i> encodes a member of the MATE family of multidrug efflux transporters |CITS:[ 9987140]|.

COMMENT - IHF, "<b>I</b>ntegration <b>h</b>ost <b>f</b>actor," is a global regulatory protein that helps to maintain DNA architecture. It binds and bends DNA at specific sites. IHF plays a role in DNA supercoiling and DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and the expression of many genes |CITS:[15102446][1447969][11827473]|.
/
/IHF is highly abundant in the cell. Its total intracellular concentration varies with growth rate and is higher in exponential phase, with 6,000 dimers per cell, than in stationary phase (3,000 dimers per cell) |CITS:[10515926]|.
/
/IHF acts mostly as an accessory factor, stabilizing a correct nucleoprotein complex. For example, IHF was originally found to be required for the site-specific recombination of phage &lambda; with the chromosome |CITS:[6251971]|. For this, IHF stabilizes the bending of the DNA to facilitate binding of the bivalent integrase molecules |CITS:[2544029]|. As another example, IHF stimulates transcription at &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. Here, IHF acts to facilitate the formation of the loop between the upstream bound activator and the &sigma;<sup>54</sup> holoenzyme |CITS:[2208275][1404379]|. 
/
/Like HU, IHF plays a role in polyamine-dependent DNA condensation. The binding to low-affinity sites and introduction of sharp bends in chromosomal DNA promote the formation of rod-like condensed structures in chromosomal DNA |CITS:[19132923]|. 
/
/IHF is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits, IhfA (HimA) and IhfB (HimD, Hip), that share about 25% amino acid identity |CITS:[3305480]|. The structure of IHF bound to DNA has been solved |CITS:[9032076]|. It binds tightly to DNA regions of about 40 bp carrying the 13-bp consensus sequence with A/T-rich elements upstream of the core consensus sequence. |CITS:[2205834][2972385][8650000]|. IHF makes no contact with the major groove and only a few contacts with the minor groove |CITS:[2541927]|. Therefore, specificity is believed to be due to the sequence-dependent structural parameters of the DNA, where A/T-rich regions play an important role. The bend angle induced by IHF is approximately 160&deg; |CITS:[8980235]|.

COMMENT - "<b>C</b>atabolite <b>r</b>epressor <b>a</b>ctivator," Cra, which was initially named "<b>F</b>ructose <b>r</b>epressor," "FruR," is a dual transcriptional regulator that plays a pleiotropic role to modulate the direction of carbon flow through the different metabolic pathways of energy metabolism, but independently of the CRP regulator |CITS:[9084760][8577250][8230205][18648770]|. For this reason the FruR regulator is implicated in the expression of a large number of operons that encode enzymes which comprise central pathways of carbon metabolism. FruR acts as an activator of genes encoding gluconeogenic |CITS:[8550429][8577250][2496106][9084760][3542978]|, Krebs cycle |CITS:[16415587][9084760]|, and glyoxylate shunt |CITS:[8195118][16415587][9084760]| enzymes, and the negative effect on genes encoding Entner-Doudoroff pathway |CITS:[9084760][18648770]| and glycolytic enzymes |CITS:[8550429][8577250][9084760]|. 
/
/FruR forms a complex with DNA in the absence of fructose 1-phosphate or fructose 1,6-phosphate, binding to an 18-bp-long sequence with an imperfect palindromic sequence |CITS:[9084760][16115199][8195118][8577250][8858581]|. In the presence of glucose it increases the intracellular concentration of the metabolites d-fructose 1-phosphate and d-fructose 1,6-phosphate, which interact with FruR to prevent its binding or displacement of the target operons |CITS:[8230205][8577250][8550429]|. FruR is inactivated upon the interaction of the inducers. FruR has been observed to be predominantly a tetrameric structure in solution |CITS:[8195118]|.
/
/FruR belongs to the GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators, which are helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins |CITS:[1805309][1639817][2198273]|. As a member of this family FruR contains two functional domains: an N-terminal domain which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, and the effector binding domain located in the C terminus, which is homologous to the periplasmic  sugar-binding protein for ribose, arabinose, and galactose.

COMMENT - RcsB protein for "<b>R</b>egulator <b>c</b>apsule <b>s</b>ynthesis <b>B</b>," is a response regulator that belongs to the multicomponent RcsF/RcsC/RcsD/RcsA-RcsB phosphorelay system |CITS:[11758943][17185552][16153174][16166540][16740933][1943696]| and is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of colanic acid capsule, cell division, periplasmic proteins, motility, and a small RNA |CITS: [16427772][16153174][7855424][8366025][2836365][10702265][8576059][10564486][3888955]
/[1999391][7534408][8763957][12864862][16000739][16776655][19026860]|. 
/
/The response regulator RcsB is the principal regulator of this system and it may form complexes with the RcsA auxiliary protein  (forming a heterodimer) |CITS:[1943696][7855424][10702265][8763957][16153174][17468243][12864862][17379715]|, while RcsB activates the others genes independently (in the form of a homodimer) |CITS:[16153174][11566985][15901715][15838058][10564486][12410838][1597415]|.
/
/RcsC is a sensor histidine kinase and is known to be a transmembrane protein composed of three domains: the external sensory domain (amino terminal), a cytoplasmic transmitter domain (carboxyl terminal), and a transmembrane hydrophobic central domain (unknown function). RcsC is a membrane-bound protein that is able to sense extracellular changes in temperature, overexpression of membrane protein, and osmolarity |CITS:[14514676][16153174][8576059]|. RcsC is a hybrid kinase, contains both an H1 and D1 domain, and is able to transfer phosphoryl groups to the conserved Hpt domain of RcsD |CITS:[16153174][16427772][16153174]|. RcsC and RcsD are inner membrane proteins that are involved in the phosphorylation of RcsB in response to environmental signals |CITS:[16153174][9209051]|. Once phosphorylated, the RcsB protein is a positive regulator  and it increases the affinity for the specific DNA-binding sites and controls the transcriptional expression of operons |CITS:[10702265][7855424][8576059][2836365][10564486][16153174]|. It is believed that  RcsF protein may also be capable of phosphorylating RcsB.
/
/The RcsB/RcsA complex has major affinity for binding sites of which RcsB is only one. The homodimers of RcsB activate transcription, interacting with the RNA polymerase, by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoter; the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5 |CITS:[16153174][11566985][15901715][15838058][10564486][12410838]|. The formation of heterodimers between  RcsB and the RcsA auxiliary protein stabilizes interactions with the distant binding sites |CITS:[10702265][8763957][16153174][17468243][12864862][17379715]|.
/
/The amount of RcsA protein is limited both by its rapid degradation by two proteases, Lon and ClpYQ, and by its low level of synthesis   |CITS:[16153174][7534408][3888955][3029041][1999391][8759878][1943696][14766922][12670962]|. 
/
/RcsB, which belongs to the two-component family, shows a helix-turn-helix motif for interaction with DNA in the C-terminal domain, while the the N-terminal domain is typical of the response regulator  |CITS:[16153174]|.

COMMENT - According to microarray analysis, the "<b>m</b>a<b>n</b>nosyl-d-<b>g</b>lycerate <b>r</b>egulator," MngR, regulates only two genes, <i>mngA</i> and <i>mngB</i>, involved in 2-<i>O</i>-&alpha;-mannosyl-d-glycerate utilization |CITS:[ 14645248]|. This regulator also autoregulates its own synthesis|CITS:[ 7805834]|.
/
/Previously,  MngR, also called FarR, for <i>f</i>atty <i>a</i>cyl-<i>r</i>esponsive <i>r</i>egulator,  had been proposed to regulate genes involved in the citric acid cycle in response to fatty acids, which release  MngR from its DNA-binding site |CITS:[ 7805834]|.  However, when it was found that this protein only regulates two genes, the suggestion was rejected  and it was proposed that probably high concentrations of fatty acids could degrade the protein instead of it binding to the regulator |CITS:[ 14645248]|.  
/
/MngR belongs to the GntR family of transcriptional regulators and has a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain and a UbiC transcription regulator-associated domain that is predicted to be a sensor for small molecules. This domain is found in proteins such as UbiC from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, TreR from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and HutC from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> |CITS:[12757941]|.
/
/The <i>mntR</i> gene is transcribed divergently from the <i>mngAB</i> operon. They share a regulatory region that contains two sites of 21 bp each, one with two direct repeat sequences of 10 bp that are bound by MngR  |CITS:[7805834]|.

COMMENT - PurR dimer |CITS:[1400170]| controls several genes involved in purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis  and its own synthesis |CITS:[2198266][2211510][2404765]|. This regulator necessarily binds two products of purine metabolism, hypoxanthine and guanine, to induce the conformational change that allows PurR to bind DNA |CITS: [1400170][2089227][2211500]|.
/
/PurR belongs to the GalR/LacI family |CITS:[12598694]|, and it shows 35%, 33%, and 26% identity with CytR, GalR, and LacI, respectively |CITS:[3058704]|. As with other members of this group, PurR shows a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain for DNA binding |CITS:[3058704][1400170]| and a ligand-binding and dimerization motif in the C-terminal  domain |CITS:[1400170]| that shows similarity with ligand binding sites of periplasmic sugar-binding proteins |CITS:[8509365][12598694]|.  The two domains are connected by a hinge sequence that is also important for DNA binding and that can be cleavage by proteases when the protein is not bound to DNA |CITS:[8132474][11910022]|. 
/
/The members of the GalR/LacI family also have a partial conservation in their DNA-binding motif which has an imperfect dyad symmetry |CITS:[3058704]|. The nonconserved nucleotides in the motif give specificity to each regulator |CITS:[3058704]|. 
/
/Except for the <i>purR</i> gene and <i>purA</i>, which both have two DNA-binding sites for PurR, all genes regulated by PurR in <i>Escherichia coli</i> have only one DNA-binding motif to bind the regulator |CITS:[2211510]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>Rha</b>mno<b>s</b>e regulator," RhaS, is a transcription factor involved in l-rhamnose degradation and transport |CITS:[8230210][7966303][8757746]|. RhaS alone is able to activate transcription of <i>rha</i> operons, but in the presence of CRP, transcription increases. On the other hand, CRP alone is unable to activate transcription of <i>rha</i> operons in the absence of RhaS. Therefore, these two regulators bind cooperatively to fully activate the operons related with transport and degradation of l-rhamnose |CITS:[16166533][8230210][8757746][10852886]|. Additionally, synthesis of <i>rha</i> operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown on l-rhamnose in the absence of glucose and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high |CITS:[16166533]|.
/
/RhaS is part of the unusual <i>rhaSR</i> operon that encodes two transcriptional regulators, RhaS and RhaR (30% identical), both members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators |CITS:[10464186][17071764]|. Apparently, expression of operons involved in transport and degradation of l-rhamnose first requires expression of RhaR, which induces transcription of the <i>rhaSR</i> operon. In this way, RhaS activates transcription of l-rhamnose gene clusters.
/
/This transcription factor is composed of two domains, a C-terminal domain that contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs and an N-terminal domain involved in l-rhamnose binding and dimerization of the protein |CITS:[15342598][18366439][17513476]|. Mutational studies carried out to define interactions between RhaS and &sigma;<sup>70</sup> suggest the existence of two interaction regions in both. The contact regions through which both proteins interact are represented by two amino acid residues in the C-terminal domains of RhaS (D241 and D250) and &sigma;<sup>70</sup> (R599 and K593) |CITS:[10940041][15342598]|.
/
/In the presence of l-rhamnose, RhaS binds in tandem to repeat sequences upstream of the <i>rhaA</i>p and <i>rhaT</i>p intergenic regions. The binding site for RhaS overlaps the ?35 region of both <i>rhaB</i>p and <i>rhaT</i>p promoters in 4 bp. The binding targets for RhaS consist of 17-nucleotide-long sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[15342598][10852886]|. It seems the binding sites of RhaS are on a different face of the DNA relative to the <i>rhaBAD</i> operon |CITS:[7966303][17513476]|.

COMMENT - TrpR, "tryptophan (<b>trp</b>) transcriptional <b>r</b>epressor," negatively regulates expression of the <i>trp</i> regulon in response to intracellular levels of tryptophan |CITS:[7012834]|. The TrpR regulon is involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, transport, and regulation. This regulon partially overlaps with the TyrR regulon, since expression of several genes is regulated by TrpR and TyrR, the transcriptional regulator of the TyrR regulon |CITS:[7961453][1904443][2061290]|.
/
/TrpR represses transcription by interfering with the ability of RNA polymerase to interact with the promoter |CITS:[1097702]|. The aporepressor is activated as a DNA-binding protein by noncooperative binding of two L-tryptophan molecules to the homodimer |CITS:[1097702][3519217][3549712]|. The consensus sequence for TrpR is described as two symmetrically arranged half-sites with the sequence GNACT separated by a spacer of 8 bp |CITS:[8613990]|.
/
/X-ray crystallography of the aporepressor |CITS:[3600756]|, the holorepressor |CITS:[3903514]|, and repressor bound to the operator oligonucleotide |CITS:[3419502]| as well as NMR studies of the repressor and aporepressor in solution |CITS:[8433368]| and bound to an operator oligonucleotide |CITS:[7957174]| reveal that the small 25-kDa protein belongs to the helix-turn-helix (HTH) family. The dimer is composed of two identical six-helical subunits, where four of the helices intertwine with the corresponding helices from the other subunit. Binding of tryptophan stabilizes the HTH and alters the orientation of the HTH such that the repressor fits into the major grooves |CITS:[3600756]|.
/
/The crystal structure of the repressor-operator complex reveals that specific binding is mostly mediated by contacts to the phosphate backbone and water-mediated hydrogen bonds, suggesting that the intrinsic DNA structure rather than the specific base pairs are recognized, a mechanism which has been termed indirect readout |CITS:[3419502]|.

These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose. Transcription of these operons is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator. In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC |CITS:[9409145][1744033][6319708][1400237][9600836][2231717][6377308]|.
/
/AraC binds to five target sites in the <i>araB</i>p region. AraC binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of arabinose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>araB</i>p |CITS:[2237403][3279415][2962192][3520549][8428590]|. AraC binding to the distal site (-123.5) has been shown to down-regulate expression of <i>araB</i>p and <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[1560456][3279415]|. 
/
/In the absence of arabinose, AraC is unable to activate <i>araB</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>araC</i>p and <i>araB</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[2237403][3279415][3520549]|. Arabinose triggers AraC-dependent activation of <i>araB</i>p and relieves AraC-dependent repression of <i>araC</i>p |CITS:[3279415][3520549]|. The <i>araBAD</i> operon is located upstream of <i>araC</i> and in the opposite direction.
/
/In the presence of arabinose, this regulator activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoters, and the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5. The binding targets for AraC consist of 17-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[9409145][8980677]|. 
/
/The AraC regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains. The solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved. It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an &alpha;-helix |CITS:[19422057]|. The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding |CITS:[9409145][8451183]|. Its crystal structure |CITS:[9367758][9103202]| reveals that the sugar molecule is bound within a &beta;-barrel, buried by the N-terminal arm of the protein. It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in the regulation of the arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of the protein. In the absence of arabinose it interacts with the DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain, and it releases it in the presence of arabinose |CITS:[9103202][18561170][19815018]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional dual regulator CRP, "<b>c</b>AMP <b>r</b>eceptor <b>p</b>rotein," also called CAP, "catabolite gene activator protein," regulates the expression of over 180 genes |CITS:[16301522][9813115][15520470]| in <i>E. coli</i>. Many of these genes are involved in the catabolism of secondary carbon sources (for reviews, see |CITS:[19033675][18359269][18628769][8394684]|. In addition, CRP is involved in many other processes, such as osmoregulation |CITS:[10601034][16885462]|, stringent response |CITS:[10966109]|, biofilm formation |CITS:[12029060]|, virulence |CITS:[16885462]|, nitrogen assimilation |CITS:[17284458][17233899][11532153]|, iron uptake |CITS:[15659676]|, competence |CITS:[19502395]|, multidrug resistance to antibiotics |CITS:[18503189][16885453]|, and expression of CyaR sRNA |CITS:[18978044]|. Transcriptome analyses have been performed |CITS:[19703305][17559662][15520470][15150239]|. Expression of <i>crp</i> is positively and negatively autoregulated |CITS:[6297782][1328816]|; repression of <i>crp</i> requires Fis |CITS:[9582281]|.
/
/CRP was the first purified transcriptional regulator and the first for which the structure was solved |CITS:[4320461][4317918][6261152][6280140][03051048]|. CRP is activated as a DNA-binding protein by binding of its allosteric effector, cAMP |CITS:[4320461][6261152][11890200]|.
/
/<b>Protein structure and allosteric activation</b>
/
/CRP belongs to the CRP-FNR superfamily of transcription factors |CITS:[14638413][11407111]|. The crystal structures of cAMP-CRP |CITS:[6286624][2828639][11124031]|, cAMP-CRP bound to DNA |CITS:[1653449][8757802][9096308]|, the cAMP-CRP-&alpha;-CTD-DNA complex |CITS:[12202833]|, and the solution structure |CITS:[19359484]| as well as the crystal structure of apo-CRP |CITS:[19805344]| have been solved. CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region. The C-terminal &alpha;-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif. It dimerizes in apo-CRP, with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core |CITS:[19805344]|. The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of &beta;-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP. A long &alpha;-helix, termed the C-helix, forms an intersubunit coiled-coil. This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP. After binding of cAMP the signal is propagated through a lengthening and reorientation of the C-helix to the DNA-binding domain, resulting in the liberation of the DNA recognition helix |CITS:[19359484][19805344]|.
/
/<b>Mechanism of transcriptional regulation</b>
/
/CRP binds to a 22-bp symmetrical site |CITS:[2557589]| and induces a severe bend upon binding, with an angle of &sim;80&deg; |CITS:[1653449][8757802][6323997][11724533]|. Two regions of CRP, AR1 ("activation region 1"), located in the C-terminal domain |CITS:[8392187][7966284]|, and AR2 |CITS:[8978616]|, located in the N-terminal domain, are known to interact with RNA polymerase (RNAP). 
/
/Promoters that are activated by cAMP-CRP can be grouped into three classes, termed class I, class II, and class III promoters |CITS:[10550204]|. Class I- and class II-dependent promoters require one cAMP-CRP for activation and have a single DNA-binding site located upstream of the RNAP-binding site, centered near position -93, -83, -72, or -62 of class I promoters |CITS:[2173826][2167178][12023077]| and overlapping the RNAP-binding site of class II promoters |CITS:[10550204]|. At class I promoters, AR1 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer interacts with the &alpha;-CTD of RNAP |CITS:[7925296]|, thereby increasing the affinity of RNAP for the promoter DNA |CITS:[1646077][8735277][8394979]|.
/
/Class II-dependent promoters require AR1 of the upstream subunit and AR2 of the downstream subunit of CRP. AR1 recruits &alpha;-CTD to the DNA region upstream of the bound CRP dimer, while AR2 interacts with &alpha;-NTD of RNAP |CITS:[8735277][8978616][9628879]|. Class III promoters require multiple activator molecules, that is, either two or more CAP dimers or one CRP dimer and additional activator proteins synergistically activate transcription |CITS:[15063844][12923087]|. Dependent on the localization of its binding site, CRP functions by a class I or class II mechanism at class III promoters or by a more complex mechanism which can involve direct interactions with the second activator |CITS:[10760178][11742992][16166533]|, or CRP exerts its function by DNA bending |CITS:[8735277][10550204][1848302]|.
/
/CRP represses transcription by promoter occlusion |CITS:[8394684]|, by exclusion of an activator protein |CITS:[2454912]|, through the interaction with a repressor protein in an antiactivation mechanism |CITS:[8394345][8736525][17158559][8969182]| or by hindering promoter clearance |CITS:[15385551][10760580]|.  
/
/<b>Catabolite repression and inducer exclusion</b>
/
/Catabolite repression in <i>E. coli</i> is mediated by the interplay of CRP, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system |CITS:[18359269][17158705][18628769]|. In the absence of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources, such as glucose, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is phosphorylated |CITS:[9822815]| and activates adenylate cyclase |CITS:[6245052][9457881]|, resulting in an elevated level of cAMP |CITS:[16407219][17675376]|. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i> |CITS:[6297782][7518773][1328816]|, cAMP-CRP levels increase. In addition, in the presence of unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, inducer is transported into the cell, leading to the inactivation of the corresponding repressor molecules |CITS:[2651862]|[<b>Magasanik70</b>*]. Therefore, transcription of catabolic genes is switched on by cAMP-CRP.
/
/If glucose is available, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is predominantly dephosphorylated |CITS:[9822815]|. As a consequence, adenylate cyclase is not activated, resulting in a reduced level of cAMP. Due to the autoregulation of <i>crp</i>, cAMP-CRP levels decrease |CITS:[1715982]|. In addition, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> blocks the uptake of inducer by blocking the transport systems ("inducer exclusion") |CITS:[16453452][7041121][7040431][11969416]|. Thus, transcription of catabolic genes is switched off.

COMMENT - ArgR complexed with L-arginine represses the transcription of several genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of arginine, transport  of histidine, and its own synthesis |CITS:[17074904][3116542][1640456]| and activates genes for arginine catabolism |CITS:[12003934]|. ArgR is also essential for a site-specific recombination reaction that resolves plasmid ColE1 multimers to monomers and is necessary for plasmid stability |CITS[3149585]|. The role of ArgR in this latter reaction may be structural |CITS[3149585]|.
/
/The hexamer is the active form of ArgR, and L-arginine binds to ArgR and stabilizes the hexamer |CITS:[ 8594204]|and increases its DNA affinity by allosteric activation |CITS:[ 8594204][15663926 ]|.
/
/ArgR belongs to the ArgR/AhrC family, whose members are widely distributed in bacteria |CITS:[11305941]|. The DNA sequence which the proteins of the family recognize and to which they bind are also well-conserved among genomes |CITS:[ 11305941]|.  This DNA sequence consists of  a palindromic sequence of 18 bp,  called the ARG box |CITS:[ 11305941][ 1640456]|. An ArgR hexamer binds to a pair of these boxes that are generally separated by 3 bp |CITS:[1640456][1640457]|.  The repressor can bind to a single box but with a greatly reduced affinity |CITS:[1640456][ 1640457]|. The ARG box generally overlaps the promoter sequence and the transcriptional start site |CITS:[1640456]|; therefore, it was suggested that it represses the transcription by steric exclusion of RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[ 17850814]|.
/
/ArgR has two domains: the N-terminal domain, which contains a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif |CITS:[ 9334747]|,  and the C-terminal domain, which contains a motif that binds L-arginine and a motif for oligomerization |CITS:[ 8594204]|. Based on cross-linking analysis of wild-type and mutant ArgR proteins, it has been shown that the C-terminus is more important in cer/Xer site-specific recombination than in DNA binding |CITS:[20659168]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor ModE, for "<b>Mo</b>lyb<b>d</b>enum," is the principal regulator that controls the transcription of operons involved in  the transport of molybdenum and synthesis of molybdoenzymes and molybdate-related functions, among others |CITS:[8564363][8931336][8550508][9210473][10446207][10206709][9851041][11092866][12029041][16205910]|. The regulatory effect of ModE is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown under anaerobic growth conditions and when the physiological inducer, molybdenum, binds to ModE and promotes the dimerization of the ModE-Mo complex.  |CITS:[10446207][10206709][9210473][12583917]|. The ModE dimer binds two molecules of molybdenum with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 0.8 mM. Tungsten can act as a substitute for Mo in ModE binding to the modABCD promoter in vitro, but the complex may be biologically inactive |CITS:[1092866]|.
/
/The binding targets for ModE consist of inverted repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[14641908][10446207][9210473][10206709]|. 
/
/A crystal structure of ModE has been solved at 2.1&Aring; resolution  |CITS:[10075916]|.
/
/The monomer of this transcription factor contains two domains: the N-terminal domain is responsible for binding DNA and the dimerization and also contains  a winged helix-turn-helix motif  |CITS:[10075916]|. The C-terminal domain is indispensable for molybdate binding and possibly is involved in the DNA binding |CITS:[11259434][8931336][10075916][12581638]|. Tentatively, this transcription factor is classified as a member of the LysR family |CITS:[9210473]|. 
/
/A microarray analysis for ModE of <i>E. coli</i> was done by |CITS:[16205910]|.

COMMENT - The transcription factor IclR, for "<b>I</b>so<b>c</b>itrate <b>l</b>yase <b>R</b>egulator," is negatively autoregulated |CITS:[8550439]| and it regulates the expression of the glyoxylate bypass operon  |CITS:[18942160][8626344][1995429][2512996][7033207][2001680]|. Transcription of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown during acetate accumulation in the exponential phase. Glyoxylate and pyruvate have been identified as effectors of IclR and show antagonistic effects. While glyoxylate favors the inactive dimeric state of IclR, pyruvate increases the binding of IclR to the aceBp promoter by stabilizing the active tetrameric form of the protein |CITS:[17426033]|.
/
/On other hand, the genes of the <i>aceBAK</i> operon are expressed to varied degrees due to two facts: first, they are differentially regulated at the translational level, and second, there is a putative premature transcriptional termination in the region preceding the <i>aceK</i> gene |CITS:[16415587]|. 
/
/
/IclR represses <i>aceBAK</i> transcription through two mechanisms |CITS:[12492863]|: (1) binding to the proximal site, overlapping the -35 promoter box, and preventing RNA polymerase binding |CITS:[8682810][1447784][2001680]|, and (2) binding to the distal site after the RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter and formed the open complex, avoiding the polymerase escape of the promoter through its interaction with the &alpha;-subunits. Perhaps the IclR binding at both sites forms an intermolecular bridge that leads to a DNA loop structure and thus enhances the <i>aceBAK</i>  repression |CITS:[12492863]|.
/
/This regulator belongs to the IclR family of repressors. IclR is composed of two domains: the amino-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is responsible for inducer binding |CITS:[1447784][2185227][17426033][8844850][1995431]|.
/
/The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of IclR (2.3&Aring;) has been solved  |CITS:[17426033]|.
/
/An <i>iclR</i> mutation affects the carbon flow in the metabolism |CITS:[15543598][15885621]|.

COMMENT - ArgP, "<b>arg</b>inine <b>p</b>rotein," controls the transcription of genes involved in the arginine transport system and genes involved in DNA replication. DNA replication is also regulated directly by ArgP when it binds to three 13-mers located in the origin of replication (OriC), blocking the DNA opening by DnaA and inhibiting this cellular process |CITS:[2034653], [2208289],[ 1733927]|. DNA binding by ArgP is prevented when the serine protease Do (DegP) hydrolyzes this transcriptional regulator |CITS: [8335089]|.
/
/To activate transcription, ArgP recognizes AT-rich DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein activates genes involved in replication, it appears to bind to their regulatory regions without a coeffector |CITS: [9254708], [9819053]|. However, the activity of ArgP depends on arginine and lysine to regulate genes involved in arginine metabolism. These amino acids, which bind to ArgP, do not seem to help the protein to form dimers or to bind to DNA, but they contribute to recruitment of the RNA polymerase and in forming the open complex. However, only the ArgP-arginine complex can produce transcripts, whereas ArgP-lysine appears to inhibit transcription |CITS: [17504942], [15150242]|.
/
/ArgP, which belongs to the LysR family, has a helix-turn-helix motif located close to the N terminus. Members of the LysR family that show considerable homology to ArgP are AmpR from <i>Citrobacter freundii</i>, MetR from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serotype Typhimurium, and NhaR from <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> |CITS: [2034653]|
/
/The expression of <i>argP</i> is induced by PhoB under phosphate starvation |CITS: [10589831]|. Contrary to the suggestion made by |CITS: [10600368]|, |CITS:[15150242]| has suggested that </i> argP</i> is not autoregulated.
/
/ArgP is also called IciA ( for "<b>i</b>nhibitor of <b>c</b>hromosome <b>i</b>nitiation") |CITS: [2034653]|.

COMMENT - "<b>D</b>NA-binding protein under <b>an</b>aerobic conditions," Dan |CITS:[20156994]|, formerly TdrR and YgiP, is an LysR-type transcriptional regulator for L-tartrate fermentation. Dan belongs to the same family of growth phase-specific nucleoid proteins as Fis, Dps, HU, IHF, and H-NS |CITS:[20156994]|. More specifically, Dan belongs to the group II nucleoid proteins, which include Fis, Rob (CbpB), CbpA, and IciA and show irregular distribution within the nucleoid |CITS:[20156994]|. Dan may have a functional dichotomy, controlling both the structure and function of the nucleoid |CITS:[20156994]|.
/
/In the presence of L- and <i>meso</i>-tartrate, Dan stimulates expression of the divergently transcribed <i>ttdABT</i> operon, encoding L-tartrate dehydratase and the L-tartrate:succinate antiporter |CITS:[19661178][16804186]|. 
/
/The <i>ttd</i> pathway for L-tartate fermentation and the <i>dcu</i> pathway for general C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate metabolism interact at the regulatory level |CITS:[19661178]|. Expression of <i>ttdR</i> (<i>dan</i> gene) is positively autoregulated in response to L-tartrate |CITS:[19661178][16804186]| and activated by the two-component system DcuSR in the presence of L-tartrate, <i>meso</i>-tartrate, or D-malate or fumarate |CITS:[19661178]|. <i>ttdR</i> (<i>dan</i> gene) is repressed by FNR and the nitrate and nitrite two-component systems NarXL and NarPQ |CITS:[19661178]|.
/
/In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay it was shown that Dan binds to the <i>ttdA-ttdR</i> intergenic region |CITS:[19661178]|.
/
/Based on genomic SELEX analysis, of a total of 688 Dan-binding sites, 504 were located within intergenic noncoding regions and 184 were within coding regions |CITS:[20156994]|.
/
/Dan binds to a DNA-binding protein with recognition preference for the GTTNATT sequence. This motif suggests a role for Dan in resistance to a metal, as with Dps against iron |CITS:[20156994]|. Dan contains two sets of Cys-Cys pairs: one consisting of Cys170 and Cys193, and other of Cys288 and Cys296 |CITS:[20156994]|.
/
/Dan is highly expressed in cells grown under hypoxic or anaerobic conditions, and it plays a role in local folding of DNA |CITS:[20156994]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>Rha</b>mnose <b>r</b>egulator," RhaR, is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in l-rhamnose degradation and coregulates with the global transcriptional regulator CRP. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of the unusual operon <i>rhaSR</i>, which encodes two transcriptional regulators, RhaS and RhaR (30% identical), both members of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators and involved in l-rhamnose transport and degradation |CITS:[16166533][11073923]|. In vitro transcription assays indicate that the &alpha;-CTD of the RNA polymerase is partially dispensable for RhaR activation and is required for CRP activation of the <i>rhaSR</i> operon |CITS: [16166533][11073923]|.
/
/Apparently, expression of the operons involved in transport and degradation of l-rhamnose first requires expression of RhaR, which induces transcription of the <i>rhaSR</i> operon. In this way, RhaS activates transcription of l-rhamnose gene clusters.
/
/Transcription of the <i>rhaSR</i> operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown on l-rhamnose in the absence of glucose. Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, l-rhamnose, binds to RhaR and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high |CITS: [16166533][11073923]|.
/
/This transcription factor is composed of two domains, a C-terminal domain that contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs and an N-terminal domain involved in l-rhamnose binding and dimerization of the protein |CITS: [15342598][18366439][17513476]|. 
/
/In the presence of l-rhamnose, RhaR binds in tandem to two repeat sequences upstream of the <i>rhaS</i> intergenic region to activate transcription by overlapping the -35 box of <i>rhaS</i>p. The binding targets for RhaR consist of 17-nucleotide-long sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences located on different faces of the DNA |CITS:[16166533]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>b</b>iotin <b>r</b>epressor," BirA, coordinately represses transcription of the divergent genes that are necessary for the synthesis of biotin |CITS:[6177001][366433]|. BirA is a bifunctional protein that possesses both regulatory and enzymatic activities: it acts as the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor of the biotin operon and also exhibits biotin ligase activity |CITS:[6129246]|.
/
/The specific inducer for BirA is  biotinyl-5'-adenylate (bio-5'-AMP). In the presence of bio-5'-AMP, BirA binds to 40-nucleotide-long DNA target sites in the <i>bioA</i>/<i>bioBFCD</i> intergenic region to coordinately repress transcription of <i>bioA</i>p and <i>bioB</i>p |CITS:[9485476][1659455]|. BirA-bio-5'-AMP has been observed to be predominantly monomeric in solution |CITS:[6129246][8373769][9485476]|, whereas more recent studies indicate that dimerization occurs before DNA binding |CITS:[12527300]|. Biotinyl-5'-adenylate |CITS:[10529178]| and biotin |CITS:[11353844][350835]| stimulate dimerization and DNA binding. 
/
/The effector bio-5'-AMP is also a substrate in the BirA-mediated biotinylation of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein monomer (apoBCCP), and this relationship results in repression of the biotin operon when the abundance of apoBCCP (and therefore the cellular demand for biotin) is reduced |CITS:[9750231]|.
/
/The crystal structure of BirA has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.3 &Aring; |CITS:[1409631]|, and that of a BirA-biotin complex |CITS:[11353844]| has been solved by several research groups. Crystallization has been described |CITS:[2642476]|, and the implications of the structure with respect to the binding of biotin and ATP have been discussed |CITS:[1409631]|.  
/
/The BirA monomer contains three domains: an amino-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif; the central domain, which is important for DNA binding and catalysis and contains the binding site for bio-5'-AMP; and the C-terminal domain, the funtion of which has yet to be determinded. Disordered loop structures on the protein surface appear to be involved in binding to biotin, bio-5'-AMP, and/or DNA |CITS:[10497026]| and in protein dimerization |CITS:[11353844]|. A model of binding and reaction progression is presented elsewhere |CITS:[11847279]|.

/
/In particular, in the absence of D-galactose, GalR represses the <i>galETKM</i> operon |CITS:[9218807]|.

This repressor binds in tandem to inverted repeat sequences that are 16 nucleotides long and possess conserved motifs; each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[7934815][8416900]|. 
/
/On the other hand, GalR is highly homologous in its amino acid sequence to GalS (55% identical and 88% similar); apparently both act together and are capable of cross-talk to regulate expression of the <i>gal</i> regulon |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. For this reason these regulators bind the same operators, in the <i>cis</i> regulatory regions, with different affinities |CITS:[8175668]|. In the presence of inductor, GalR undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. Golding et al. showed that GalR is the major repressor of the <i>gal</i> operon |CITS:[1655705]|.
/
/GalR belongs to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators. Accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains the DNA-binding region, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and dimerization |CITS:[1619663][8982002]|. GalR and GalS have only two substitutions in the first helix of the N-terminal domain |CITS:[1619663]|.

COMMENT - MhpR, "<b>h</b>ydroxy<b>p</b>henylpropionate <b>r</b>egulator," participates in controlling the expression of several genes involved in degradation of phenylpropionate (PP) |CITS:[9098055][12748194]|. MhpR is able to bind to its DNA-binding site even in the absence of inducer; however, increasing concentrations of inducer improve the binding strength of MhpR. 3-(2,3-Dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP), two intermediates of the metabolic pathways, are the principal inducers of MhpR. The third inducer, phenylpropionate (PP), acts synergistically with DHPP and 3HPP |CITS:[12748194][19520845]|.

COMMENT - Lrp, "<b>L</b>eucine-responsive <b>r</b>egulatory <b>p</b>rotein," is a dual transcriptional regulator for at least 10% of the genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS:[12374860]|. These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions, including 1-carbon metabolism |CITS:[1346534][12675791][7968922]|. In addition, Lrp affects nearly three-fourths of the genes induced upon entry into stationary phase |CITS:[12374860][19052235]|. Lrp might also play a topological role in dynamic DNA packaging |CITS:[8212136]|.
/
/Lrp can act as a repressor or activator for its target genes. Binding of leucine can affect these activities in three different ways: leucine either potentiates, antagonizes, or has no discernible effect upon Lrp action |CITS:[1532173][8432705][8561478]|. It is believed that Lrp senses the presence of rich nutrition based on the concentration of leucine and positively regulates genes that function during famine and negatively regulates genes that function during a feast |CITS:[7968922]|.
/
/Lrp forms a mixture of octamers and hexadecamers |CITS:[11575919]|. In the presence of leucine the octamer configuration is favored. It is believed that the switch between the octameric and hexadecameric states modulated by leucine affects the binding and the activity of Lrp at its target genes |CITS:[12054800]|. The structure of Lrp from <i>Escherichia coli</i> bound to DNA as an octamer has been solved |CITS:[17223133]|. Lrp forms an open ring structure, in which the DNA is wrapped around the octamer in a nucleosome-like structure. The monomer chain contains two domains, an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal &alpha;&beta;-sandwich fold. 
/
/Lrp-regulated promoters commonly contain multiple adjacent binding sites for the protein with low sequence specificity. A consensus recognition sequence has been described |CITS:[8636076]|. The identified 15-bp sequence motif is structured with flanking CAG/CTG triplets and a central AT-rich signal. Leucine has two effects upon binding to DNA <i>in vitro</i>: the affinity of Lrp is reduced but the cooperativity of binding to multiple sites is increased |CITS:[15571719]|.
/
/Lrp belongs to the Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which is widely distributed throughout the eubacterial and archaeal domains. Lrp appears to be very well conserved in members of the &gamma;-proteobacteria |CITS:[12675791]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>Mal</b>tose regulator," MalT, is a transcription factor that activates transcription of several genes and operons involved in maltose catabolism and transport |CITS:[10973069][1918057][1544897][7040340][7830577]|. This regulator is sensitive to catabolite control and is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown on maltodextrin in the absence of glucose |CITS:[6315676][8952481][8895588]|. MalT is a STAND transcription factor,  <b>S</b>ignal <b>T</b>ransduction <b>A</b>TP bases with <b>n</b>umerous <b>d</b>omains |CITS:[20545845]|.
/
/MalT is monomeric in solution, but in the presence of maltodextrin and ATP it forms multiple complexes (oligomers) in its target promoters and activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of promoters |CITS:[1544897][1918057]|. The binding targets of MalT consist of 10-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[1918057]|.
/
/The gene <i>malT</i> is located upstream of the operon <i>malPQ</i> and in the opposite direction |CITS:[9529892][10973069][11931562]|. This transcriptional activator |CITS:[3015733]| belongs to the LuxR family of activators. MalT subunits consist of four domains: the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, the N-terminal ATP-binding domain, and two domains (DT2 and DT3) involved in effector recognition (maltotriose) |CITS:[15733913] [11209048][11709169][8227007][12003949]|. Based on an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach, it was shown that the inducer maltotriose binds inside the cavity of the tetratricopeptide-like sensor domain of MalT, a bacterial STAND transcription factor |CITS:[20545845]|.
/
/MalT activity is negatively regulated by Aes and MalY through direct protein-protein interactions and competition with maltotriose for MalT binding |CITS:[12374803][11867639][12003949][10692154]|. These characteristics point toward identical modes of action for MalY and Aes. However, the identification of an amino acid substitution in MalT that suppresses Aes inhibition without interfering with MalY inhibition suggests that the binding sites of the two inhibitory proteins are not the same |CITS:[11867639][12003949]|. In addition, MalK inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT; interestingly, however, MalK interacts directly with MalT in the absence of maltotriose but not in the presence of maltotriose |CITS:[15180985][15733913]|.

COMMENT - DnaA plays an important role in initiating chromosomal replication to bind sequences in the chromosomal origin. 
/It belongs to the DnaA family of transcriptional regulators.
/
/DnaA also binds to sites at the datA locus and this binding serves to limit excess DnaA activity, but other DnaA-binding sites are shown not to share this function |CITS:[12068813]|. 
/
/Regulation has been described |CITS:[11483528][9674428][16077105]|. IdaB is a member of the AAA chaperone-like family of ATPases |CITS:[11483528]| that is required for the inhibition of the initiation of DNA synthesis via antagonism of DnaA activity by the DNA polymerase III beta subunit (sliding clamp) |CITS:[9674428][11483528]|.  IdaB and the sliding clamp stimulate ATP hydrolysis within the DnaA-ATP complex, which renders it inactive, and DNA replication activity also contributes to this downregulation |CITS:[9674428]|.
/
/DnaA also can inhibit the gene expression of other genes such as guaA, dam, rpoH, ftsA, and mioC.

COMMENT - MelR, "<b>mel</b>ibiose <b>r</b>egulator," is a transcription factor involved in disaccharide melibiose degradation.  It coregulates with CRP, a global transcriptional regulator |CITS:[11742992][10760178][2851497]|. These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of the operon involved in transport and catabolism of melibiose. Synthesis of this operon is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown on melibiose in the absence of glucose. Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, melibiose, binds to the MelR regulator and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high.
/
/In the presence of melibiose, MelR binds in tandem to repeat sequences in the <i>melR</i>/<i>melAB</i> intergenic region to activate transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the promoter <i>melA</i>p. The binding targets for MelR consist of 18-nucleotide-long repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved sequences |CITS:[10760178][11742992][10747919]|. 
/
/MelR binds to five target sites in the <i>melA</i>p region. MelR binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the presence of melibiose, and it is absolutely required for expression of <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[10760178]|. MelR binding to the distal site (-237.5) has been shown to down-regulate the expression of <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p |CITS:[16621812][10760179]|. 
/
/In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate <i>melA</i>p, but it regulates its own expression by repressing <i>melR</i>p and <i>melA</i>p simultaneously |CITS:[10760178][11752325][9409145]|. Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of <i>melA</i>p and relieves MelR-dependent repression of <i>melR</i>p |CITS:[9409145][11752325]|. The <i>melAB</i> operon is located upstream of <i>melR</i> and in the opposite direction.
/
/This regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family of activators and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer. It is composed of two domains: the carboxy-terminal domain, which contains the DNA-binding region, and the amino-terminal domain, which is responsible for dimerization and l-arabinose binding |CITS:[7784205][2684786][1445207][9108148][12675795]|.

COMMENT - The transcriptional dual regulator CynR, "<b>cy</b>a<b>n</b>ate <b>r</b>egulator," activates the expression of the <i>cyn</i> operon, which is involved in use of cyanate as a sole nitrogen source, in the presence of the inducer cyanate |CITS:[3049588][1592818]|. It negatively regulates its own transcription independently of cyanate |CITS:[1592818]|.
/
/CynR belongs to the family of LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) |CITS:[1592818][8253686]|. Members of this family have a conserved structure with an N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal cofactor-binding domain. They typically form tetramers in solution that can be regarded as dimers of dimers |CITS:[12706716][19047729]|. In accordance with this, the CynR regulatory domain is sufficient for dimerization, whereas the full-length protein behaves as a higher-order oligomer |CITS:[19760662]|.
/
/The promoter regions for the divergently transcribed <i>cynR</i> and <i>cyn</i> operons overlap. CynR binds cooperatively to a 60-bp region that contains two 9-bp repeats separated by 34 bp. The binding region overlaps the -35 region of the promoter for the <i>cyn</i> operon and both the -10 and -35 region of its own promoter |CITS:[8253686][7961413]|. CynR binds to DNA in the presence or absence of cyanate and induces bending of the DNA |CITS:[7961413]|. Cyanate decreases the amount of bending, suggesting that the change in bending acts as a transcriptional switch.

Transcription of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown under anaerobic growth conditions and when the physiological inducer, formate, binds to the FhlA protein |CITS:[1779767][8412675][2118503][8034727]|. When formate binds to FhlA, the protein becomes active as the binding affinity of FhlA increases, and it activates the transcription of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. 
/
/HycA may inactivate the function of the FhlA protein and prevent the binding of FhlA to target sequences, but the mechanism of the negative regulation by HycA is unknown |CITS:[1625581][17938909]|.
/
/FhlA is subject to posttranscriptional regulation by the sRNA OxyS |CITS:[12753181][10903857][9774350]|. This sRNA binds to FhlA mRNA and inhibits translation by interfering with the binding of the mRNA and the ribosome  |CITS:[9230301][10903857][9774350]|.
/
/As a member of the group of &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcriptional regulators, FhlA contains three domains: a possible sensory domain located in the N terminus that probably modulates the activity of the C-terminal domain |CITS:[11700359][7751289]|; the central domain, which is probably involved in open complex formation, ATP hydrolysis, and interaction with &sigma;<sup>54</sup> and formate |CITS:[1833069][7751289][8981978]|; and the C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding |CITS:[10848985]|. FhlA shows 46% identity to the HyfR protein, a member of the same group. These proteins are dissimilar in their N-terminal regions, which in FhlA recognizes formate. However, they show only one different residue in their helix-turn-helix motifs, suggesting that they recognize similar DNA-binding sites |CITS:[9387241]|.
/
/Leonhartsberger <i>et al</i> suggested that this protein binds to degenerate regions 16 bp in length (CATTTCGTACGAAATG) |CITS: [10848985]|. However, alignments made by the curators of this database showed that the sequence is less conserved in the upstream regions regulated. This result also showed that the motif TGTCGnnnnTGACA is conserved in the sequences examined, and for this reason the binding sites for FhlA regulation have been relocated, reassigned, and corrected.
/
/The consensus sequence TGTCGnnnnTGACA is in agreement with alignments determined by the curator for these upstream regions and with the corresponding evidence obtained in the bibliography of every operon, including similarity to the consensus sequence and the data from footprinting assays, computational analysis, and profiling of FhlA-dependent gene expression |CITS: [8034728][14702328]|. The FhlA-binding sites are represented by an inverted 14-bp repeat motif.

COMMENT - HcaR, "<b>h</b>ydro<b>c</b>innamic <b>a</b>cid <b>r</b>egulator," directly regulates genes involved in 3-phenylpropionate (also called hydrocinnamic acid) catabolism.Proteome analyses have shown that HcaR regulates the production of 30 proteins involved in several processes; however, it is unknown whether this regulation is direct or indirect |CITS: [15808934]|.
/
/HcaR, which belongs to the LysR family, shows a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain and a multimerization motif in the C-terminal domain |CITS: [9603882]|. It is not currently known how many monomers form the multimeric complex. A putative HcaR DNA-binding site sequence of 13 bp, matching the binding motif of LysR-type regulators, has been identified |CITS: [9603882]|.
/
/Homologous proteins 100% identical to HcaR have been found in pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains, including  O157:H7, and in <i>Shigella flexneri</i> |CITS: [15808934]|. 
/
/The <i>hcaR</i> gene, which is transcribed divergently from an HcaR-regulated operon, is induced during stationary phase in an RpoS-independent manner, whereas it is repressed in the presence of glucose |CITS:[11200225]| and in the absence of oxygen through the indirect effect of ArcA |CITS:[15808934]|.

COMMENT - AllS, "<b>all</b>antoin", transcriptional activator participates in controlling genes involved in the utilization of allantoin as a nitrogen source. Although AllS binding does not depend on the presence of allantoin, this compound appears to be necessary for activation, perhaps by interacting with AllS |CITS:[12460564]|.
/
/AllS belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators, and like other members of this family, it has a putative helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal domain |CITS:[12460564]|.
/
/Expression of the <i>allS</i> gene is negligible under aerobic conditions and is increased under anaerobic conditions in the presence of glyoxylate or allantoin. In the absence of its repressor, AllR, <i>allS</i> is expressed under nitrogen-limiting growth conditions, but its induction is independent of the regulators Nac and NtrC, which are active under these conditions |CITS:[12460564]|.

COMMENT - The "<b>Pr</b>o<b>p</b>ionate <b>R</b>egulator," PrpR, is a transcription factor that controls expression of genes involved in catabolism of propionate |CITS:[15805526]|. It is negatively autoregulated, sensitive to catabolite control, and coordinately activates transcription of a divergent operon related to propionate catabolism |CITS:[15805526]|. Synthesis of this operon is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown in the absence of glucose or glycerol. 
/
/PrpR belongs to the NtrC family of activators, which interact directly with the RpoN RNA polymerase |CITS:[ 7934866]|. PrpR is a &sigma;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activator and belongs to the AAA+ superfamily of mechano-chemical ATPases. It consists of three domains, an amino-terminal domain involved in effector recognition, a catalytic domain, and a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain |CITS:[15528672]|. This regulator binds to a palindromic sequence that overlaps the <i>prpR</i>p |CITS:[15805526]|.

/
/The binding targets for NhaR are 17 nucleotides long. Each dimer binds to one of these conserved sequences. The lengths of the degenerate binding sites of NhaR were defined according to the matrix shown for this regulator in the database RegPrecise, which contains matrices generated from alignments of orthologous regions |CITS: [19884135]|.

COMMENT - GlcC (for "glycolate utilization") negatively controls the expression of genes involved in the utilization of glycolate as the sole source of carbon |CITS:[9880556][8606183]|. It is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activated by transcription of the divergent operon <i>glc</i>, which is related to the transport and metabolism of glycolate |CITS:[9880556]|. Synthesis of <i>glc</i> genes is induced when <i>Escherichia coli</i> is grown on glycolate  |CITS:[9880556]|. 
/
/GlcC features an N-terminal domain containing a helix-turn-helix motif |CITS:[8606183]| and a putative C-terminal domain that includes the key residues involved in coinducer recognition and oligomerization. 
/
/Although little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the GlcC transcription factor, Pellicer et al. demonstrated that it is a regulator that acts as a repressor by binding to <i>cis</i>-acting elements, inverted repeat sequences that are not well-conserved, that overlap the ATG sequence |CITS:[9880556]|.
