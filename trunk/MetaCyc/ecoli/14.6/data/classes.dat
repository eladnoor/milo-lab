UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Databases
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.

UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Paralogous-Gene-Groups
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Each instance of this class describes a single group
/of paralogous genes.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)

COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a

UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Binding-Features
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-NAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Non-traceable author statement
COMMENT - Non-traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication such as a review, a meeting abstract,

UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-TAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement
COMMENT - Traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,
/but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported
/the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.
/In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,
/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IGI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from genetic interaction
COMMENT - IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> "Traditional" genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.
/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,
/process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B
/using IGI).

COMMENT - IMP inferred from mutant phenotype.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as
/<ul>
/    <li> Any gene mutation/knockout

/Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or
/abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP
/(compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies 
/or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no

/This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of
/interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such
/as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is
/simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-TAS
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement to experimental support
COMMENT - Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  However, the statement did reference another publication describing an experiment 
/that supports the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.
/In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,
/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.

/synthesized, but is cleaved from the protein even before the synthesis of the
/protein is complete. Mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins that are synthesized

/extended polypeptides on the cytoplasmic and external or vesicular sides.
/Receptor and ion channels have between one and twelve such domains.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Zn-Finger-Regions
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is
/a limited and local parallel of DNA and protein sequences, the occurrence of the
/contacting amino acid residues in the protein sequence falls into a regularity, or
/register, that creates in the protein a syllabicity.

TYPES - Amino-Acid-Sites
COMMENT - A site on a polypeptide in which a single residue is covalently modified.  Most subclasses
/of this class uniquely specify what the precise modification is (e.g. phosphorylation, methylation,
/etc.).  For cases in which the modification is known but cannot be uniquely specified using a 
/subclass (because it is not practical to define such a subclass), the compound structure slots
/(e.g. STRUCTURE-ATOMS, STRUCTURE-BONDS, etc.) can be used to supply the chemical

//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Production
TYPES - Regulation-of-Gene-Products
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.

UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA.

TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic
/acid-free at the protein level.
/The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by

/A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain
/for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into
/multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide
/synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes

UNIQUE-ID - Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are:
/
/1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these peroxiredoxins contain two conserved cysteines and are
/homodimeric enzymes where the two subunits interact in the catalytic cycle and are linked via a
/disulfide bond in the oxidized form. Eukaryotic 2-Cys proxiredoxins, which are exclusively localized
/in the chloroplast, are also shown to regulate H2O2-mediated signal transduction |CITS: [9263459]|.
/
/2. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine and are
/preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.
/
/3. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| (also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these can use
/thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as the reductant and can exist in multiple isoforms localized in plants in
/many subcellular compartments, including one form in plastids |CITS: [12913160]|.
/
/4. |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins| ((also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these are
/homologues of the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migrating protein and function as monomers
/|CITS: [10998352]|.

COMMENT - An instance of this class should be a single reaction involving only a small number of defined participants, 
/in contrast to large complicated processes that can be better classified under the Complex-Processes
/class (e.g., transcription or translation).  Simple-Reactions should be considered indivisible at the current level of abstraction,
/but it is possible to define a decomposition of a simple reaction into a lower level set of sub-reactions, that
/exist at a different level of abstraction.  Simple-Reactions are therefore simple in comparison to
/Complex-Processes, not because they cannot be decomposed.

UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.

/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - a polyprenol
COMMENT - The nomenclature of polyprenols and polyprenyl phosphates is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Polyprenols are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/According to one method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/The other method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. According to this method the same molecule is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. 
/For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

UNIQUE-ID - Porphyrins
TYPES - Macrocycles
COMMON-NAME - a porphyrin
COMMENT - A porphyrin is a heterocyclic macrocycle derived from porphine, a molecule that consists of four pyrrole

/Substituted porphines are called porphyrins. Many porphyrins occur in nature, and fulfil important
/biochemical roles. 
/Porphyrins can bind metals to form complexes. The metal ion, usually with a charge of 2+ or 3+,
/resides in the central cavity formed by the loss of two protons. Many metals are found with different
/derivatives, including Fe, Mg, Ni, Co and Zn.
/The name porphyrin comes from a Greek word for purple, since most porphyrins are red to purple
/in color. More reduced porphyrins, such as corphins, are yellowish.

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a holo-AsbD protein
COMMENT - AsbD is an aryl-carrier protein that activates |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| prior to its incorporation into |FRAME: CPD-9985|. 
/The AsbD protein itself needs to be activated by the transfer of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| group from |FRAME: CO-A| to serine 40 of the apo form, resulting in the active holo form, in a manner similar to other acyl- and aryl-carrier proteins.
/
/The AsbC protein catalyzes the adenylation of |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|, followed by the transfer of the adenylated intermediate to the holo-asbD protein, resulting in |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| |CITS: [17346033]|.
/
/Once activated, the |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| moiety can be transferred by AsbE from |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| to different receipient molecules, including |FRAME: CPD-11479|, |FRAME: CPD-11480| and |FRAME: CPD-11481| |CITS: [18758617]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is 
/isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal
/electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
/flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
/ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
/The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
/sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
/iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of
/these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMENT - Putidaredoxin (Pdx) is a 106-residue (11.6  kDa) ferredoxin that is produced in |FRAME: TAX-303| strains. It contains a |FRAME: CPD-6| and carries electrons from the flavoprotein putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) to the acceptor cytochrome CYP101, also known as P450cam because it catalyzes camphor hydroxylation. This NADH-supplied electron-transfer chain is one of the best studied of the P450 systems. The structure of Pdx was determined by NMR methods |CITS: [8204575]|. The electronic properties and redox interactions of Pdx have been extensively studied |CITS: [1445875][8845752][8663375][9268300][10433692]|.
/Pdx carries one electron at a time, such that the two irons switch between [Fe3+, Fe3+] (oxidized) and [Fe2+, Fe3+] (reduced) states |CITS: [15103126]|.

COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|, |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|,
/|FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| and |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins|.

UNIQUE-ID - Type-II-Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Peroxiredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a type II peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - DsbD
COMMENT - DsbD is an inner membrane protein that transfers electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the
/periplasmic substrate proteins DsbC, DsbG and CcmG. DsbD consists of three domains: a periplasmic
/N-terminal domain (nDsbD), a central transmembrane (TM) domain (tmDsbD) with eight predicted TM
/helices and a periplasmic C-terminal domain (cDsbD) |CITS: [10760137]|.
/
/The electron cascade is
/initiated by the reduction of tmDsbD by thioredoxin, cDsbD then shuttles electrons from tmDsbD to
/nDsbD and reduced nDsbD passes the electrons onto the periplasmic substrate proteins. It appears that
/unlike DsbB, which has a bound quinone for electron transfer |CITS: [10854438]|, tmDsbD is capable of
/shuffling electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm without involvement of an additional cofactor
/|CITS: [18571669]|. Transfer of electrons across the membrane is thought to occur via thiol disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[12925743], [17641688], [19258316]|.

/
/Upon its activation by |FRAME: Thrombins "thrombin"| factor V is spliced in two chains that noncovalently bind to each other in a reaction mediated by calcium. In its active form, known as |FRAME: Factor-Va "factor Va"|, it functions as a cofactor of the thrombinase complex.
/
/The |FRAME: Factor-Xa "activated factor X"| enzyme requires |FRAME: CA+2| and activated factor V to convert |FRAME: Prothrombins "prothrombin"| to |FRAME: Thrombins "thrombin"| on the cell surface membrane.
/
/|FRAME: Factor-Va "Factor Va"| is degraded by activated protein C, one of the principal physiological inhibitors of coagulation (see |FRAME: 3.4.21.69-RXN "EC 3.4.21.69"|).

UNIQUE-ID - Factor-VIII
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a factor VIII
COMMENT - |FRAME: Factor-VIII "Factor VIII"| is an essential blood clotting factor also known as anti-hemophilic factor (AHF). It is a cofactor for |FRAME: Factor-IXa "factor IXa"| which, in the presence of |FRAME: CA+2| and phospholipids, forms a complex that converts |FRAME: Factor-X "factor X"| to the activated form |FRAME: Factor-Xa "factor Xa"|.
/
/The factor VIII gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts. Transcript variant 1 encodes a large glycoprotein, isoform a, which circulates in plasma and associates with von Willebrand factor in a noncovalent complex. This protein undergoes multiple cleavage events. Transcript variant 2 encodes a putative small protein, isoform b, which consists primarily of the phospholipid binding domain of factor VIIIc. This binding domain is essential for coagulant activity.

COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes. 
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters.

/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. 
/
/The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from

UNIQUE-ID - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein which contains a cysteine 
/disulfide/dithiol active site.  The protein functions in a wide variety of cellular 
/processes.  Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by 
/thioredoxin reductase. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced 
/forms results in a change of conformation.  The functional properties differ 
/between the two forms of thioredoxin.  The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful 
/protein disulfide reductase, thioredoxin catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange 
/reactions.  The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, 
/the reduced form has been solved by NMR. |CITS: [3896121] [3152490]

COMMENT - Note that the enzyme performing this function has only recently been characterized, and not completely (see PMID:11818558). The common and systematic names have been suggested by TIGR, who have recently compiled an HMM model for this gene (TIGR00216). The enzyme appears to catalyze the final step in the non-mevalonate terpene biosynthesis pathway. Its two products, isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, are apparently generated from a common intermediate formed by the enzyme. The mechanism and identity of the reductant have not yet been determined.

/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.

/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.

COMMON-NAME - cofactor F<sub>420</sub>
COMMENT - One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green fluorescence when irradiated with UV light. This fluorescence is due to F420, a cofactor that was identified on the basis of this feature.
/This compound, named for its intense absorbance at 420 nm, was originally isolated by Cheeseman et al |CITS: [5079072]|, and later identified by Eirich et al as the N-(N-L-lactyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-L-glutamic acid phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate |CITS: [728375]|.
/
/The F420 biosynthetic pathway produces the intermediate F420-0, which contains no glutamate side chains.
/Glutamates are then added by several enzymes. F420 molecules isolated from different organisms differ in the number of the glutamate molecules in the side chains, as well as the nature of the bond (which could be either &alpha; or &gamma;) |CITS: [12909715][12867481][11717263]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acid-Synthase-ACPs
TYPES - All-ACPs
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid synthase containing an [acyl carrier protein] domain
COMMENT - This class includes the universal and highly conserved carriers of acyl intermediates that are involved
/in fatty acid synthesis, generally named ACP, or [acyl carrier protein].
/In yeast and mammals, ACP exists as a separate domain within a large multifunctional fatty acid
/synthase polyprotein (type I FAS), whereas in bacteria and plastids it is a small monomeric protein
/(type II FAS). Bacterial ACPs can also serve as acyl donors for synthesis of a variety of products,
/including endotoxin and acylated homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their "apo" inactive form, and are activated by attachment of a
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to a serine residue, in a reaction
/catalyzed by 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase |CITS: [18059524]|. The activation converts

UNIQUE-ID - Polyketide-ACP-Proteins
TYPES - All-ACPs
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide synthase containing an [acp] domain
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are found in soil and marine filamentous bacteria, as well as in fungi and
/higher plants, and are responsible for producing such therapeutically important natural products as
/erythromycin and lovastatin.
/Analogous to the fatty acid synthases, PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins
/(type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps
/using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a
/ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an ACP. The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the
/flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized ferredoxin
COMMENT - Ferredoxins are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes. 
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to
/as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into three groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/The first group consists of monomeric proteins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster, which includes ferredoxins
/that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms
/(from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers
/in photosynthesis. 
/
/The other two groups consist of ubiquitous proteins containing [3Fe-4S]/ [4Fe-4S] and are typically found in bacteria.
/They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain
/(up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins that were first isolated from
/anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is 
/isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal
/electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
/flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
/ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
/The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
/sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
/iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of
/these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway.  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.

/
/The class denoting EC number "1.2.3" will be a parent of the instance denoting the reaction whose EC  number is 
/"1.2.3.4", and of zero or more instances denoting reactions assigned a partial EC number of "1.2.3.-".
/Partial EC numbers indicate that the class of the reaction is known, but no sequence number within the class has been
/officially assigned.

/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 612 carbons.

//
UNIQUE-ID - UDP-NAcMur-Peptides
TYPES - UDP-sugar
COMMON-NAME - a UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide
COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and
/contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation.
/The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases
/can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599]
/[5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few
/coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-7688| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the
/&alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY|
/|CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD-7692|
/|CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is
/involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common
/residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all
/Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia,
/lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and
/cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been
/documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|,
/|FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|,
/|FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: CPD-7689| |CITS: [16562051]|. 
/In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of
/<i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as
/|FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER|
/|CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species
/enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE|
/|CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide
/antibiotic vancomycin.

UNIQUE-ID - Jasmonic-Acids
TYPES - Jasmonates
COMMON-NAME - a jasmonic acid
COMMENT - Jasmonic acid is an important phytohormone. Four different stereoisomers of this compound exist, based on the
/bond orientation at positions 3 and 7 on the cyclopentone ring. This compound represents the general structure for all four
/forms.
/
/Only two of the stereoisomers occur naturally:
/|FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium
/within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers
/within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But,
/in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|.
/
/The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA
/metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

COMMON-NAME - a jasmonoyl-isoleucine
COMMENT - Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has been detected in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [15258265]| and a number of other plant
/species |CITS: [18812165][SEMBDER93][17273867]|. There are two different naturally occurring stereoisomers of this
/compound, |FRAME: CPD-11232| and |FRAME:CPD-11259|, that can spontaneously interconvert through epimerization
/|CITS: [19349968]|. 
/
/In Arabidopsis thaliana, JA-Ile promotes binding between the COI1 F-box protein and the JAZ1 repressor involved
/in jasmonic acid-mediated signaling |CITS: [17637677]|. Therefore, JA-Ile promotes the degradation of JAZ1.
/Initial studies suggested that |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"| was a biologically active phytohormone
/|CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
/later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
/]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
/biological activity originally associated with |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"|. A pure preparation of that stereoisomer
/does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.
/
/JA-Ile has also been detected in |FRAME: TAX-49451| and plays a role in defense responses |CITS: [17085687]|
/but it is unclear which
/form of JA-Ile is active in this process.

UNIQUE-ID - Anthraquinones
TYPES - Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an anthraquinone
COMMENT - Anthraquinone derivatives are found in microorganisms, fungi, plants, marine organisms, and insects. In higher plants, most anthraquinones occur as mono- or diglycosides. The yellow or red colored compounds have some commercial relevance as natural dyes. 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones serve as laxatives.
/
/In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the s uccessive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha-keto-acyl chain which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

UNIQUE-ID - Apo-AsbD-Proteins
TYPES - Aryl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an apo-AsbD protein
COMMENT - AsbD is an aryl-carrier protein that activates |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| prior to its incorporation into |FRAME: CPD-9985|. 
/The AsbD protein itself needs to be activated by the transfer of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| group from |FRAME: CO-A| to serine 40 of the apo form, resulting in the active holo form, in a manner similar to other acyl- and aryl-carrier proteins.
/
/The AsbC protein catalyzes the adenylation of |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|, followed by the transfer of the adenylated intermediate to the holo-asbD protein, resulting in |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| |CITS: [17346033]|.
/
/Once activated, the |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| moiety can be transferred by AsbE from |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| to different receipient molecules, including |FRAME: CPD-11479|, |FRAME: CPD-11480| and |FRAME: CPD-11481| |CITS: [18758617]|.

COMMENT - This class includes the inactive form of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), universal and highly conserved
/carriers of acyl intermediates during fatty acid synthesis.
/In yeast and mammals, ACP exists as a separate domain within a large multifunctional fatty acid
/synthase polyprotein (type I FAS), whereas in bacteria and plastids it is a small monomeric protein
/(type II FAS). Bacterial ACPs can also serve as acyl donors for synthesis of a variety of products,
/including endotoxin and acylated homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their "apo" inactive form, and are activated to |FRAME: ACP|
/by attachment of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to a serine
/residue, in a reaction catalyzed by 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase |CITS: [18059524]|.

UNIQUE-ID - NRPS-PCP-Proteins
TYPES - Peptidyl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an NRPS containing a [peptidyl-carrier-protein] domain
COMMENT - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are typically polyfunctional modular megasynthases found
/mainly in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, and participate in assembly line biosynthesis of
/peptide-based natural products, such as the antibiotic vancomycin and the siderophore enterobactin.
/The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein
/(PCP) domains.
/
/The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of
/an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the
/|FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond
/formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor
/by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.
/
/PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that
/contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of
/D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin semiquinone
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a flavin mononucleotide) that is 
/isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal
/electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron
/flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows
/ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity.
/Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR).
/The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism,
/sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of
/iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of
/these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

COMMON-NAME - post-translational protein modification
COMMENT - This term should only be used to annotate modifications that occur after the protein has been released from the ribosome, and are therefore strictly post-translational. Modification of a free protein (one not attached to a ribosome) and C-terminal modifications are post-translational. Some protein modifications occur while the protein is still in the ribosome but before translation has been completed; these modifications are considered co-translational and should not be annotated using this term.

//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Quinoline Alkaloids Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The biosynthetic origin of quinoline alkaloids is the aromatic amine anthranilic (2-aminobenzoic) acid involved in the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. The skeleton of quinoline alkaloids constitutes a bicyclic system with a fused benzene and pyridine ring. The attachment of a furan ring to the pyridine nucleus generates furoquinolines (e.g. furacridone), an important subgroup of quinoline alkaloids. The plant family <i>Rutaceae</i> represents the major source of quinoline alkaloids, e.g. maculine. Quinoline alkaloide are known to possess pharmaceutical activites but only a few such as quinine are used in medicine because of their antimalarial properties.
//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLIZIDINE-ALKALOIDS

//
UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycosaminoglycans
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a glycosaminoglycan
COMMENT - Glycosaminoglycans (also known as mucopolysaccharides) are important components of connective tissues. They are composed of long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit. The repeating units consist of an <i>N</i>-acetyl-hexosamine and a hexose or hexuronic acid, either or both of which are often sulfated.
/Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid
/unit they contain (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-12521|, |FRAME: CPD-12515|, galactose, |FRAME:CPD-12557|, |FRAME: CPD-12541|). 
/
/Glycosaminoglycans are divided into four main classes:  |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| and |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate|; |FRAME: HEPARIN| and |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate|;  |FRAME: Hyaluronan|; and |FRAME: KERATAN-6-SULFATE|. With the exception of hyaluronan, the polysaccharide chains are linked covalently at the reducing end to a core protein through an <i>O</i>-glycosidic linkage to a serine residue, thus forming proteoglycans.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-C552-Ox

COMMON-NAME - an oxidized cytochrome <i>c552</i>
COMMENT - The cytochrome <i>c552</i> family includes periplasmic cytochromes that function\s in nitrite reduction in Gram-negative bacteria such as enteric bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio.
/The enzyme, which is encoded by the nrfA gene, covalently binds five |FRAME: HEME_C| groups and one |FRAME: CA+2| ion per monomer |CITS: [9593308]|.  
/It is believed that the cytochrome <i>c</i> encoded by the nrfB gene is responsible for the direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome <i>c552</i>.  The reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i> can then directly reduce nitrite to ammonia.
/Formate, pyruvate, ethanol, and D-lactate can serve as electron donors |CITS: [5338848][6381645][8409924] [7934939] [8057835][8039676]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c552</i> from |FRAME: TAX-915| is a misnamed 9.1-kDa monoheme protein and does not belong to this family. It belongs to the cytochrome <i>c551</i> |CITS: [9746537]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-CL-Red

COMMON-NAME - a reduced cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub>
COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> is a relatively large (about 19 kDa) acidic cytochrome that is specifically involved in electron transfer from the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase |CITS: [6263253][6295363]|.
/Despite its relatively large size it contains only one heme. Its amino acid suggests that it is completely different, except for its haem-binding site, from all other cytochromes |CITS: [2851998]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> has been cloned and studied from several methylotrophic bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-272630| |CITS: [3129405][2842733]| and |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [1657871]|.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Heparan-Sulfate
TYPES - Glycosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - heparan sulfate
COMMENT - |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| binds to specific proteins such as antithrombin and several growth factors, thereby regulating various biological processes including anticoagulation and angiogenesis |CITS: [9151776]|. The unique sulfation pattern of a monosaccharide sequence within HS is believed to be critical for binding to the target protein.
/
/Heparan sulfate is a member of the |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| family. It consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit which is composed of a hexuronic acid and a hexosamine.
/The most common repeating unit, which makes up around 50% of the total disaccharide units in heparan sulfate, is composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521| linked to |FRAME: CPD-12541|. In other units |FRAME: CPD-12521| may be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12515| or its sulfated form |FRAME: CPD-12518|, and |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| may be sulfated to |FRAME: CPD-12565|, or may be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12532| or |FRAME: CPD-12533|.
/
/The structure of |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| is very similar to that of |FRAME: HEPARIN|. However, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains |CITS: [15047699]|.

COMMON-NAME - RNA splicing, via transesterification reactions
COMMENT - Note that nuclear mRNA, Group I, Group II, and Group III introns are all spliced by a series of two transesterification reactions that occur within the RNA itself, or between two RNAs in trans splicing. Some of these require one or more proteins to stabilize the catalytic conformation, while others are autocatalytic. Note that tRNA introns are spliced by a different catalytic mechanism.

COMMON-NAME - RNA splicing, via endonucleolytic cleavage and ligation
COMMENT - Note that while typically associated with tRNA splicing, this mechanism of splicing is known to be used for some non-tRNA substrates, e.g. HAC1 (YFL031W) in S. cerevisiae and an intron in the 23S rRNA of the Archaeal species Desulfurococcus mobilis.
